# Pangenome Task
The pangenome is a collection of genomes from genetic diverse individuals. Unlike the existing reference GRCh38, which was built using data from just a few individuals (mostly of European ancestry), the pangenome aims to represent populations across the globe and to really “capture global genomic diversity”. 
## Why is it so interesting?
-	To represent diversity, align haplotypes to each other and capture structural variants &rarr; which can impact gene function
-	For precision medicine: more accurate testing and diagnosis across all ancestries &rarr; reduce bias in healthcare 
-	Capture genetic sequences that are missing from previous reference genomes &rarr; reduce observational bias
-	Has high levels of assembly quality due to “better sequencing technology and coordinated innovations in assembly algorithms”
## What’s the future benefit?
-	Study the role of structural variants in diseases to gain a better understanding
-	More equity in medicine and health care for underrepresented populations
- Possibly find new therapeutic targets for different genetic pathways &rarr; supports precision medicine
- Possibly improves gene-editing accuracy: If population-specific variations are accounted for, it could help create more accurate CRISPR machinery to target the correct regions
## What makes the T2T approach different from previous reference genome constructions?
The T2T Consortium was the first to complete the human genome sequence in 2022, filling the roughly 8% that was missing from GRCh38. They did this by including telomeres, centromeres and highly repetitive regions. By providing a gapless reference, it enabled identification of variants in previously unresolvable regions.
