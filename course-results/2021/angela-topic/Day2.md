# Resources for reference genomes and varaint data
==================================

## [UCSC](http://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html)
This is a platform from the Univerity of California in Santa Cruz. It orginated from the Human Genome Project. One can look up a gen, a position of interest and see where it is located in the genome resp. which gene it is and also in what other kind of species it exists. On default also the gene expession and the sites with the most commen SNP's are shown.

## [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/human/)
Here you find a lot of different databases for example for DNA sequenes, epigenomics databases and human variant collections. Some of theme are mentioned below. Also it is possible to conduct a BLAST search for a sequence alignement.
### NCBI:dbSNP
This is a database for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and multiple small-scale variations including insertions/deletions, micorsatelites and non-polymophic variants. One can search for positions, gene names etc. It will then show different samples and also what the frequencies are in different populations for this kind of variation.
### NCBI:dbVAR
This is a database for genomic structural variation(VAR) like -insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, multinucleotide substitutions, mobile element insertions, translocations, complex chromosomal rearrangements. When searching for a gene it shows different variation, its location and what kind of variation it is. 
### NCBI:ClinVar
It is a database for which contains information about variationan its relationship to human health. By looking up a gene or a region different variants ar popping. For each variant it contains the typ of variation, if it ia pathogenic and the location.

## [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)
It is again a platform for gemone browsing. By entering eighter a gene, position or protein one can get a lot ofinformation like sequence splice variants, gene expression, regulation and a lot more. And again this platform offers different other tools like BLAST. 

## [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic)
It is a database for somatic mutation in cancer. One can select different tissues for example and then the all genes are displayed and one can select the one with possible mutation which have an impact on the developement of cancer.
