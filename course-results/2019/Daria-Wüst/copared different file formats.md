Which file format would I use for storing variations?
--> To store variations I would use the VCF-file format, because it shows in an ‘easy and clear’ way the 
variations to a specific reference genome. It needs the smallest storage and is also one of the cheapest option 

Which file format would I use for full archival purposes?
--> I think the best option for this is the BAM-file format. Because it uses binary code to store the full sequence alignment 
(compressed way).BAM also allows searching after indexing. 
Another option would be CRAM, which is even more compressed than the BAM file-format. 

Which file format would I use for presenting a sequence? 
--> I would use the FASTA-sequence because it’s very simple to ready and also very flexible.
