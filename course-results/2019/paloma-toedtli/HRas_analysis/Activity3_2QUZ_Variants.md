# Activity 3 - Variants in a gene (HRas)

### EVA (European Variation Archive)
EVA is an open access database containing all types of genetic variation data from all species.
The variant browser displays 610 coding variants of the protein HRas from 12 differents studies allowing to
have an overview of all coding variants discovered within the gene.

### Ensembl
We can use Ensembl for obtaining more information on genetic variation.
table of variants:
On Ensembl we can sort the variants according to MAF, variant's consequence, clinical significance and many more.

HRas variant table was first filtered out with the following criteria:
Consequences: missense variant
Clinical significance : pathogenic
MAF was not selected since the resulting table had no MAF dependant variants

In the mentioned table was found the VOI (Variant Of Intrest) causing the Costello syndrom and its pathogenocity
can be further analyzed with Ensembl in the phenotypes section. Analysis of HRas phenotypes shows likely diseases and traits related
to variants in the gene. Among the entries, all kind of cancer types can be found along with developmental disorders.
### UniProtKB
UniProtKb can provide informations on variants location whether they overlap with sites and/or domains,
whether the variants lie on a post-translational modification (PTM) residue and other protein structural features.
In the present study, the variants causing diseases are mainly located on the GTP-binding site.
Almost all other variants are non-disease related or still unknown.
