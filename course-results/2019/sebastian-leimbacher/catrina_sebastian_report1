__Mutational landscape of metastatic cancer revealed from prospective clinical sequencing of 10,000 patients__
1. What is the biological question?
Identifying clinically relevant somatic mutations, novel noncoding alterations, and mutational signatures that were shared by common and rare tumor types -> to guide the selection of genomically matched therapies	
(Mainly druggable or in the near future druggable mutations)

2. What	is the method?
-Patient consent and accrual, tumor and blood sample (reference)
-MSK-IMPACT (ustom hybridization capture–based assay of genes that are draggable by approved therapies or targets of experimental therapies + frequently mutated genes in human cancer) detects sequence mutations, small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations and select structural rearrangements
-Simultaneous sequencing of tumor and matched normal blood samples
-determination fo tumor type, tumor purity & way of nucleic extraction
- DNA isolation, quality control, library preparation and sequencing
-automated data management system, which initiates the analysis pipeline
-Sequence reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using BWA MEM
-Resequencing of cases that failed owing to either low coverage (<50×) or obvious sample contamination was attempted whenever possible
-Comparison to other tumor-profiling strategies (WES, downsampling necessary)
- Comparison to the mutational landscape of primary tumors (comparison to TCGA)

3. What	significant scientific contribution does the paper make?
-69% of the somatic mutations detected by MSK-IMPACT were not previously reported in the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database (v78)
-largest analysis of somatic mutations in the TERT promoter across all tumor types reported to date
-gene fusions involving ALK, RET and ROS1, for which effective targeted therapies exist in lung cancer, were found in 11 additional tumor types (Not previously reported)
- Now created data set will prove a transformative resource for identifying novel biomarkers to inform prognosis and predict response and resistance to therapy.

Impact of genetic variation on three
dimensional structure and function of
proteins
1. What is the biological question?
Difference in structure of proteins with a single amino acid swap -> wide range of structural and functional changes caused by single amino acid differences, including changes in enzyme activity, aggregation propensity, structural stability...

Certain SNVs may be useful for predicting individual responses to particular drugs, susceptibility to other exogenous factors such as environmental toxins, or risk of developing disease
binding, and dissociation, some in the context of large assemblies
SNV --> phenotype (difficult)
2. What	is the method?
-Construction of the dataset
-identifie 2596 structures extant in the PDB for which non-synonymous SNV could be mapped via LS-SNP/PDB.
-elected only those structures for which the dbSNP mutation information matched information coming from UniProt and the 3D structure
-filtering for database inconsistencies

3. What	significant scientific contribution does the paper make?
Detailed analysis of wide range of structural and functional changes caused by single amino acid differences, including changes in enzyme activity, aggregation propensity, structural stability,
binding, and dissociation, some in the context of large assemblies
