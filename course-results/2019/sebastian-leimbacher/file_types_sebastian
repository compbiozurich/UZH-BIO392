2504 Genomes
6469.66 Mbase per Genome
2 bits are needed to encode a base

If no overlap: 2 * 2504 * 6469.66 Mb = 32'400'057.28? Mbits 4000000mb
Overlap of x7.8: 7,8 * 2 * 2504 * 6469,66 Mbase = 31,5 Tb (WGS) (mean coverage about 7.8x)
Only 1 % exons: 0,1 * 64 * 2 * 2504 * 6469,66 Mbase = 26 Tb (WES) 64x overlap 
1 letter = 1 byte = 8 bits
Therefore Mbase/8 = Mb

SAM
-Template 715 Mb (No overlap, insignificant)
ca. 200 characters per line = 200 bytes
Sequence length: about 40 bases
6469.66 Mbases / 40 bases = 161,74M
7.8 coverage: 161,74M * 7,8 = 1261572000 Lines
200 bytes * 1261572000 Lines = 252.314.400.000? = 252 Gb per Genome
252 Gb/Genome * 2504 Genomes = 631 Tb

BAM
Binary compression of SAM, filesize normally about 1/4
--> 631/4 = 158 Tb
Usefull to safe file size, not readable for normal humans as in binary, yet all information from sam still remains.

CRAM
From BAM to CRAM
Lossless: 0,74 * 158 Tb = 117 Tb
8 bins: 0,42 * 158 Tb = 67 Tb
no qualtiy scores: 21 Tb --> not very usefull, uncontrolled information loss
(File size reduction from google)

Compresses BAM files eather with information loss or without, yet the information loss can be controlled and therefore this is a valubal option no lower file size.

VCF
88.3M Different Variations found (PPP 2. day)
around 80 characters per line (without sample colums) --> 80 bytes per line is a normal value1 Line per Variation (insignificant besides the 15024 bytes)
+ column per probe (2504) at around 6 bytes = 15024 bites --> total of 15104 bytes per variation
88300000 * 15094b = 1.332.800.200.000 b = 1.3 Tb
Small file size without information loss (but the overhead), every sample could be recreated form reference and all variations the specific sample consists of. This will use up a lot of calucation power as it needs to go through the 1.3 Tb of data to find each variation to add.

FASTA
With no overlap, yet every base needs now 1 byte = 8 bits
8 * 2504 * 6469.66 Mb = 129.600.229,12 Mb => 129.6 Tb / 2504 genomes
Readable but inefficant for storage and no annotations, information loss because of no overhead

BED
Around 60 characters per line = 60b
For every annotation 1 line
For every Probe
(Annotations guess: gene transcripts 226950 gene transcirpts, If short variants and sturctural variants are not annotated...)
2504 * 60b * 226950 = 34 Gb 
Pretty small file size, probably faaaaar more annotations than assumed.
Not very usefull file type to store the data, usefull for transfer into internet browser p.ex., yet in a bit project like the HGP there should really be a need for such a trasfer as most will be processed locally.
