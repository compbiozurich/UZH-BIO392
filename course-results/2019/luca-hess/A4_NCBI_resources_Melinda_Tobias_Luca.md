### Searching for our Protein hSOD on NCBI Variation viewer

###### Which chromosome is it located on?
SOD1 is located on Chr 21:31,659,622 - 31,668,931.

###### What information is contained in dbVar?
dbVar is NCBI's database of human genomic structural variation — insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, mobile elements, translocations, and others.

For SOD1 we find 242 entries of which the majority (228) are copy number variations.

###### What information is in dbSNP?
dbSNP contains human single nucleotide variations, microsatellites, and small-scale insertions and deletions along with publication, population frequency, molecular consequence, and genomic and RefSeq mapping information for both common variations and clinical mutations.

For SOD1 we find 2626 entries of which the majority (2327) are single nucleotide variants.

###### What information is in ClinVar?
ClinVar is a freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence.

For SOD1 we find 150 variants reported in ClinVar. There are reports for 61 SNVs and 87 copy number variations of which 115 have been labled phatogenic and 6 are labled likely-phatogenic.

###### Filtered by selecting; In ClinVar – yes;Most severe clinical significance – pathogenic; Molecular consequence – missense variant
###### How many variants are there for SOD1 with this filtering?
Using this filter we find 34 variants in SOD1
