### What does reviewed mean?

In this case, "reviewed" means that a "Biocurator" has manually checked and verified the quality of this data uploaded to UniProt.

### Searching for HSOD gives two entries:

P00441 SODC_HUMAN Superoxide Dismutase [Cu-Zn]  
O14618 CCS_HUMAN Copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase

Our protein of interest is SODC_HUMAN.

### UniProt ID:

P00441

### Important Sites:

We find eight different metal binding-sites.
Four of them are catalytic copper binding at positions: 47, 49, 64 and 121. The other four are Zinc binding, one structural and the other three via pros nitrogen (nitrogen closest to alpha-carbon). The structural Zinc is at position 84, the other three at positions 64, 72 and 81.

### Natural Variants

There are many natural variants of this protein, mostly evenly spread with an increased density of variants around sequence positions 80-100 aswell as a smaller "peak" at positions 20-40. Variants affecting metal binding sites don't seem to be in these "variant-rich" regions.

The variant 1N19 we were previously interested in is located at position 5 (A > V) and has the identifier: dbSNP:rs121912442. This variant has been found to be related to a severe form of ALS. It reduces structural stability and enzyme activity of the protein. It also increases the tendency to form fibrillar aggregates.

### Biological Function

It belongs to the family Superoxide Dismutases.
According to UniProt, it destroys radicals which are normally produced within the cells and which are toxic to biological systems.
