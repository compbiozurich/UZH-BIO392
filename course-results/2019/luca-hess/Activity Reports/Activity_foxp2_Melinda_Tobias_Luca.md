## 4. BLAST  

Aligning the sequences of the human foxP2 protein isoform 1 and the
foxP2 of Pan troglodytes gives the following results:  
Max score: 1431  
Length of alignment: 715  
Query Coverage: 100%  
Percent identity: 99.58%  
Percent positives: 99% (714/716)  
Gaps: 0% (1)  
e-value: 0.0  

## 5. Dot Matrix  

Sadly impossible to do, due to changes in the NCBI BLAST interface.

## 6. Cell location  

According to UniProt, foxP2 is located in the nucleus. It is involved in
speech language disorder 1 (SPCH1). It causes severe orofacial dyspraxia resulting in
incomprehensible speech. The natural variant is a non-synonymous mutation that exchanges
arginine for histidine (locus: 553).  

## 7. foxP2 Cat  

NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_001106648.1

## 8. BLAST Cat  

The "gap open" and "gap extension" penalties are part of the criteria used to score an alignment. They are different, because evolutionarily it is more difficult to open up a gap
compared to extending one (so "gap open" is a higher negative score).  

Looking at results for Homo Sapiens alignment with foxP2 of Cat.  
### a)  

Max score: 1396  
Length of alignment: 707  
Query Coverage: 100%  
Percent identity: 97.90%  
Percent positives: 97% (700/715)  
Gaps: 1% (8/715)  
e-value: 0.0  

### b)  

Max score: 1379  
Length of alignment: 707  
Query Coverage: 100%

## 9. BLAST Default  

Perhaps this has changed since the exercise was written, but the standard values
BLAST uses are 11 and 1 as seen above under a).

## 12. Humanized Foxp2 accelerates learning by enhancing transitions from declarative to procedural performance  

For their paper Christiane Schreiweis et al. created mouse lines with human foxp2 alles. 
Those differ by wt alleles by to amino acid substitudes which are highly conserved in humans. 
FOXP2 is the sole gene to date firmly linked to speech and language development.
They find that humanized Foxp2 mice has an effect on behavioral learning dynamics as well as on striatal dopamine levels, gene expression levels, and synaptic plasticity.
Humanized Foxp2 differentially influences the functional contributions of the associative and sensorimotor striatum to learning dynamics compared with the wt. 
Foxp2hum/hum mice exhibited an altered interaction between the declarative and procedural learning strategies, favoring the procedural system when both learning systems were engaged as indicated by their more rapid transition toward procedural behavior in contrast to the wt. 
The relation between declarative and procedural learning strategies and language learning is itself unclear. A Hypothesis raised by the authors is that efficient proceduralization might accelerate probabilistic learning of language features by chunking single speech and language related actions into sequences, a feature potentially contributing to adapting the human brain for speech and language acquisition.
