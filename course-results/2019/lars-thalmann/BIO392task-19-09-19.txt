SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map):
Commonly used to store sequence data (reads) aligned to a reference genome, it stores information as 8-bit text characters. The average size of a SAM file for WGS at a coverage depth of 30X is roughly 500GB.

1000 Genomes Project had a depth of 7.4X for WGS, so 1 sample = (7.4/30)*500GB = 123.33GB.
The project also performed WES at a depth of 65.7X. While the human genome is 3.27*10^9 bases, the human exome is only 9.981*10^7 bases -- 3% of the genome. Thus, WES for 1 sample = 0.03*(65.7/30)*500GB = 32.85GB.
There were 2504 samples, so the total data set = 2504*(123.33GB+32.85GB) = 391'075GB.
100GB incurs a storage cost of CHF50, so the entire data would cost CHF195'538 to store.

BAM (Binary Alignment Map):
Very similar to SAM, but stores sequence information as 2-bit binary characters, since only 4 possible values are necessary to accommodate (normal) DNA bases. This significantly reduces file size compared to SAM by a factor of approx. 5.

Going off of previously calculated values:
1 WGS sample = 0.2*123.33GB = 24.66GB
1 WES sample = 0.2*32.85GB = 1.314GB
The enire data set = 0.2*391'075GB = 78'215GB
Data cost: 0.2*CHF195'538 = CHF39'108

CRAM:
Separates each column into its own block, which improves compression, making the file 30-60% smaller than its equivalent in BAM (or SAM). 

Assuming an average size reduction of 45% compared to BAM:
1 WGS sample = 0.55*24.66GB = 13.56GB
1 WES sample = 0.55*1.314GB = 0.72GB
The enire data set = 0.55*78'215GB= 43'018GB
Data cost: 0.55*CHF39'108 = CHF21'509

BAM/CRAM are are suited for archival storage, since they compress data significantly while allowing uncomplicated access to (almost) raw data, whereas VCF only retains the most necessary parts.


VCF (Variant Call Format):
Stores a single reference genome plus any variants from the sample(s) that deviate from it, thus reducing overall file size since redundant information is largely omitted. Uses 8-bit text characters and has a 2D "grid" to store information, with each row representing 1 variant and each column representing 1 call. Notably, file size doesn't depend on depth as variants are only stored once each per file.

An average VCF file for WGS is approx. 125MB. For WES, one can then assume 0.3*125MB = 37.5MB
Thus, for 2504 samples, total data size = 2504*(125MB+37.5MB) = 406'900MB = 397GB
Hence, storage cost = 397GB*(CHF50/100GB) = CHF199

VCF is compact and inexpensive, and best suited for storage of called variants.


FASTA:
Stores text-based sequence information in a similar manner to SAM. It's fairly simplistic, making it easy to process sequences and manipulate files with a variety of programs. While I couldn't find anything about the size of an average FASTA file for WGS, I assume it would be similar to a SAM file as the formats are comparable.

FASTQ is a variant used specifically for biological sequences which stores both every element of a sequence and the quality score for that element as 1 letter each. This reduces file size considerably, making it comparable to the size of a BAM file.


BED (Browser Extensible Data):
Optimized for use in a browser environment (as the name suggests), it provides a flexible way to define the data lines that are displayed in an annotation track. Stores chromosome and coordinate data for features of a genome/sequence and can be extended to include a variety of other information.

For instance, the LiftOver feature of the UCSC Genome Browser we've used earlier in the lecture accepts this type of file as input.

Since the size of a file depends both on the number of recorded features (rows) and the amount of additional information (columns) provided, BED file size can vary considerably.
