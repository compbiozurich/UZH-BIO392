## 1)Questions to the text:
**Functions of the Src kinase?**

It’s a signalling protein which is involved into control of cellular growth, cell structure and cell communication. It adds phosphate groups to special tyrosine amino acids in protein which are included in the mentioned actions. By adding the phosphate groups, Scr kinase turns the proteins on. 

**Is there only one Src kinase?**

No, the researchers have discovered hundreds of tyrosine kinases which are very similar to the Src kinase, such as Hck or Abl.

However on Uniprot we found 10 human Src

**What’s the difference between v-Scr and c-Src?**

The v-Scr comes from a virus called Rous virus, the c-Src is the cellular one. The viral Scr is constantly active and can cause cancer. 

**Purpose of durgs gainst Src?**

The drug designed against Src is called Gleevec; it blocks the continually activity of Abl. Researchers try to inhibit the constant activity of theses kinases to restore normal growth. 

## 2)PDB	ID	1OPL	name	of	the	article?
Structural basis for the autoinhibition of c-Abl tyrosine kinase.

## 3)Search for reviewed human Scr kinases with Src as protein family.
**How many human Src are there?**

10

**How many Uniref100?**

_Definition: UniRef100 combines identical sequences and sub-fragments with 11 or more residues from any organism into a single UniRef entry._

10

**How many Unifre90?**

_Definition: UniRef90 is built by clustering UniRef100 sequences such that each cluster is composed of sequences that have at least 90% sequence identity to, and 80% overlap with, the longest sequence (a.k.a. seed sequence)._

## 4)Align them all. 
**Can you find any region/ residues that are highly conserved?**

Yes, for example the DFG motive is present in all, so it’s a much conserved motif which is closed to the active site. 

**How conserved is the active site residue?**

The active site is really conserved; there is always a D (= aspartic acid) in every of the ten proteins. Asp is a negatively charged amino acid.
Also the region around the active site (aspartic acid) is really conserved; we observe in all ten proteins the same sequence: HRDL. 

**Are there any variants around the active site residue?**

Yes, there are natural variants in five of the ten proteins; three of them are in the DFG motif.

##5) Visualization with Uniprot
We picked the Scr kinas HCK (P08631). Because there are different PDB entries for the HCK, we took the one with the largest coverage. In our case, there were two which had the same coverage: 

*1AD5, position 79-526

*2HCK, position 79-526

![Image Structure HCK](course-results/2019/jonas-kretz/Images/Activity4_Image2_HCK.png)
* _Image 2: 2HCK, red dots= water atoms (uniprot.org)_


For the visualization, we took 2HCK. The red dots in the picture are the water atoms. In total, we have four water atoms in it. 
We tried to arrange it that it has a similar to the Abl kinase in the paper. If we compare our result to the one of the Abl in the paper, we see that these two are not superposable, which makes sense then they are two different proteins form the same family. 
Nevertheless, the loop on top-left seems to be very similar and also the over-all shape is quiet the same.  We tried to mark the active site in this picture be we were not able to figure it out. But from the UniprotKB (Uniprot viewer) we know that the active site is at position 381, which is in the protein kinase domain of the protein. 
The structure was identified with the X-ray method.
