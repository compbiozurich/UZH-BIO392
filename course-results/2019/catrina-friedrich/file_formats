# 1000 Genome Project:

> "_All individuals weresequenced using both whole-genome sequencing (mean depth 7.4X)
> and targeted exome sequencing (mean depth 65.7X)_",
(1000 Genomes (2015): A global reference for human genetic variation)


## SAM

Sequence alignment map file with a size of 500 GB for a sample with
30X coverage.
But for 1000 genome Project the depth 7.4X. (times 4.05 less)
(WGS)
storage: 500GB/4.05 \* 2504 = ~300 TB
(WES) Exome is 1% of the whole genome and coverage depth twice as high
storage: 500GB \* 2 \* 0.01 \* 2504 = ~25 TB



## BAM

BAM is the comprised binary version of SAM (binary alignment map)
100 GB for sample file with 30X.
(WGS)
storage: 100GB/4.05 \* 2504 = ~60 TB
(WES)
storage: 100GB \* 2 \* 0.01 \* 2504 = ~5 TB



## VCF

Variant call Format has a row for each variant.
Gerstein Lab: 88.3 million different variants in humans.
2504 samples means there will be so many columns
Each sample column requires 6 characters
-> 6 bytes \* 2504 = 15 MB per line just for the samples
Since the number of the other columns is so small (maybe additional 70 characters per line), I will not consider them.
8.83 \* 10^7 \* 15MB = 132.45 \* 10^7 MB = 1'327 TB
(WGS)
storage: 1'327 TB
(WES) (Assuming that only 1% of all variants occur in the exome)
storage: 13.27 TB
Compressing VCF files with BGZip and indexing it with Tabix
is the standard way VCF files are stored (reduce storage needed)


## FASTA

Very similar to BAM/SAM files, but in ASCII characters, so text-based.
So 8 bits instead of 2 bits per base --> 4 times as much as:
(WGS)
storage: 60 TB \* 4 = ~240 TB
(WES)
storage: 5 TB \* 4 = ~20 TB


## CRAM

Reference-based alternative to SAM.
They are a compressed version of the alignment.
CRAM files store data in columns that are aligned to the reference sequence,
allowing users to extract information efficiently from particular subsets
of the file on particular chromosomes


The cost directly correlates with the amount of storage needed. (0.5CHF/GB)
