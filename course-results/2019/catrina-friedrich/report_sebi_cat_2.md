__Are these natural variants close to the active site in sequence?__ \
*Even though the protein has catalytic activity (4 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> = 4 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O) and interacts with several other proteins, there is no information about the sites.*

__Find out more about your protein. What is its biological function? What does it do?__ \
*It delivers Fe<sup>2+</sup> to promote the biosythesis of heme proteins or to assemble/repair iron-sulfur clusters. \
Because it can oxidize Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> it is __believed__ to protect the cell against iron-catalyzed oxidative stress. \*
