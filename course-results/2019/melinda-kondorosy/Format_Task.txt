WGS:

With a 7.4x (read depth) (source: from the 100 Genome Project paper) 

1 genome = 715MB 
2504 genome = 1’790. 360 GB 

30x BAM file = 100GB
7.4x BAM file = 24.64GB

One 7.4x BAM file consists of one genome sample with a 7.4x coverage and uses 25 GB.
For 2504 genomes it takes  2504 x 25GB =  62600 GB. 
Therefore if 100 GB in BAM format costs 50CHF, 62600GB, storage size for the 1000 genome project, will cost 626CHF. 

WES: 

Protein-coding DNA makes up only 1% of the whole genome.
Meaning, if WGS uses 62600GB and costs 626CHF WES will use a storage of 626 GB and cost 6.26CHF. 

BAM format: 
Is a compressed binary format. It stores aligned reads. 

SAM:

Is a text-based format and a approx. 5 times bigger than a BAM file. Uses approx. 500GB per sample for a 30x coverage. 

For the 100 Genome project:
30x SAM file = 500GB
For 2504 Genomes it takes 313’000 GB storage.
And costs 250CHF/100GB:  78’250CHF. 

VCF: 

Text format which covers the variants of a genome sample compared to the reference genome. 

1 whole genome file = 125 MB 
2504 genomes = 313 GB 
If 1GB costs 0.5 CHF then 313GB costs 156.5 CHF.
