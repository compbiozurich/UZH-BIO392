Report 3, 27.09.2019, Philipp & Johanna

We started our investigation on EVA (European Variation Archive). This archive provides 1539 variations for the protein SOD2 on the human GRCh38.p3 reverence genome and 6587 variations for the GRCh37 reference genome.
We decided to continue with the GRCh38.p3 for our further search. On the output-table it was also apparent that our protein of interest is located on chromosome 6.

We continued with the ensemble website with links we found on the table for our variation request.
For our gene of interest on the SNP, missense variant (variant ID rs4880) was listed. This variant seems to have clinical significance regarding drug response to cyclophosphamide, which is a drug used in chemotherapy and works as an immune suppressor. Furthermore, it might be involved in microvascular complications of diabetes, however, that databank entry was not reviewed by expert panel.
The dbSNP website told us that the transcript variants are located at position 47(T > C) on the SOD2 gene which corresponds with the change of Valine to Alanine at position 16 in the amino acid sequence. For verification we calculated how many bases are used for 16 amino acids and calculated which three bases code for amino acid 16 (in this case Valine) using the fact that each codon consists of three bases. We determined that bases 46-48 code for this amino acid. Consulting the DNA codon table confirmed that a change T to C at position 47 (second base of respective codon) results in a mutation Valine to Alanine.
We then went to UniProt to the feature viewer and saw - as expected - that there is in fact a variant at position 16 that is likely related to disease.
This is the only entry on the feature viewer for a disease-related variant for this protein.
