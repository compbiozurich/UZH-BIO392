Report 2, 26.09.2019, Philipp & Johanna

For our protein we got four results in our search on UniProt (when searching for SOD2), however only the very first entry was actually our protein,
superoxide dismutase 2, that is transcribed from the gene SOD2. The UniProt ID is the same as the one in PDB (P04179).
The entry is reviewed, which means that it is a UniProt/Swiss-Prot manually reviewed entry, as opposed to the UniProtKB/TrEMBL unreviewed entries.
This serves the purpose of securing high quality of the presented data.

As noted above the UniProt-ID is P04179 (in the previous report the UniProt-ID was denoted as 5VF9 for wildtype or 1VAR for the variant, which was a mistake).

Position 16 contains a disease related natural variant. This is fairly close (in sequence) to the metal binding site at position 50.
Other metal binding sites are registered on  positions 98, 183 and 187.


Known molecular functions of Superoxide dismutase 2 include binding to other, identical proteins/peptides (required because the protein is a homotetramer),
binding to Mn2+ ions as cofactors and enzymatic activity.

SOD2 neutralizes superoxide by converting it to O2 and hydrogen peroxide. SOD2 is active within the mitochondria, however it is transcribed in the
nucleus.

By converting ROS (reactive oxygen species) SOD2 is involved in protecting the cells from oxidative stress from free radicals. Physiologically speaking elimination of
ROS is important for several functions, for example aging processes, regulation of apoptotic processes and cell proliferation and regulation of blood pressure.
