|Disease|Disease description|Gene|Variants|
|-------|-------------------|----|--------|
|Hemochromatosis|a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet|HJV|NM_213653.3:c.959G>T|
|Thalassemia|An inherited blood disorder characterized by a decreased synthesis of one of the polypeptide chains that form hemoglobin. Anemia results from this abnormal hemoglobin formation.|HBB|NG_000007.3:g.71609_72227del|
|Haemophilia|Hemophilia is usually an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly. This can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding following injuries or surgery.|FGG|NM_021870.2:c.902G>A|
|Cystic Fibrosis|Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease affecting epithelia of the respiratory tract, exocrine pancreas, intestine, hepatobiliary system, and exocrine sweat glands.|CFTR|NM_000492.4:c.2T>C|
|Tay sachs disease|Tay-Sachs disease is a rare genetic disorder passed from parents to child. It's caused by the absence of an enzyme that helps break down fatty substances. These fatty substances, called gangliosides, build up to toxic levels in the brain and spinal cord and affect the function of the nerve cells.|HEXA|NM_000520.6:c.1549dup|
|Fragile X syndrome|Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder caused by changes in a gene called Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1).  FMR1 usually makes a protein called FMRP that is needed for brain development. |FMR1|NM_002024.6:c.-129CGG|
|Huntington's disease|Huntington's disease is a condition that stops parts of the brain working properly over time. It's passed on (inherited) from a person's parents. It gets gradually worse over time and is usually fatal after a period of up to 20 years.|HTT|NM_002111.8:c.52CAG|

|Gene|Gene name|Chromosomal location|Gene product|Disease|Disease description|
|----|---------|--------------------|------------|-------|-------------------|
|CFTR|CF transmembrane conductance regulator|7q31.2|epithelial ion channel, transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane|Cystic fibrosis|a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity|		 |
|CYBB|cytochrome b-245 beta chain|Xp21.1-p11.4|Critical component of the membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes that generates superoxide. It is the terminal component of a respiratory chain that transfers single electrons from cytoplasmic NADPH across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen on the exterior. Also functions as a voltage-gated proton channel that mediates the H(+) currents of resting phagocytes. It participates in the regulation of cellular pH and is blocked by zinc.|granulomatous disease, chronic, X-linked|X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGDX) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by onset of symptoms in the first months or years of life. Patients present with recurrent infections, lymphadenopathy, inflammatory bowel disease, granulomatous colitis, fever, skin infections, osteomyelitis, and/or abscesses.|
|HJV|hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor|1q21.1|Acts as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor (PubMed:18976966). Through enhancement of BMP signaling regulates hepcidin (HAMP) expression and regulates iron homeostasis.|hemochromatosis type 2A|Hemochromatosis type 2 is a disease in which too much iron builds up in the body. This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. While many organs can be affected, iron overload is especially likely to affect the liver, heart, and pancreas.|
|CDKN2A|cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A|9p21.3|Acts as a negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by interacting strongly with CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibits their ability to interact with cyclins D and to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein.|melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome|Melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome is an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome in which mutation carriers have an increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer. Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer.|
|KRAS|KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase|12p12.1|Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (PubMed:20949621). Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:23698361, PubMed:22711838). Plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in a ZNF304-dependent manner.|1. Noonan syndrome, 2. cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, 3. Costello syndrome|1. Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that prevents normal development in various parts of the body. A person can be affected by Noonan syndrome in a wide variety of ways. These include unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, other physical problems and possible developmental delays.; 2. Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body, particularly the heart (cardio-), facial features (facio-), and the skin and hair (cutaneous). People with this condition also have delayed development and intellectual disability, usually ranging from moderate to severe.; 3. Costello syndrome is a very rare genetic condition. It happens when there's a change (mutation) in a gene called the HRAS gene. This happens in a child's DNA before birth. Costello syndrome causes problems that affect the heart, muscles, bones, skin, brain, and spinal cord.|
|TP53|tumor protein p53|17p13.1|Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type. Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 ex...|1. Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1, 2. familial ovarian cancer|1. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (lee-FRAH-meh-nee) is a rare hereditary or genetic disorder that increases the risk you and your family members will develop cancer. People who are female at birth who have Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a nearly 100% chance of developing breast cancer.; 2. A diagnosis of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC) is considered when there are multiple cases of breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer on the same side of the family. The chance that a family has HBOC increases in any of these situations: 1 or more women are diagnosed at age 45 or younger.|
|FMR1|fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1|Xq27.3|Multifunctional polyribosome-associated RNA-binding protein that plays a central role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity through the regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA dendritic transport and postsynaptic local protein synthesis of a subset of mRNAs.|Fragile X syndrome|a genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability|
