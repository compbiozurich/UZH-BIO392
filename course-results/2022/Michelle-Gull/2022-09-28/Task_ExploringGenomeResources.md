# Task: Exploring Genome Resources

## General Genome Resources 

### [DECIPHER](https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk)
> DECIPHER (DatabasE of genomiC varIation and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl Resources) supports the interpretation of genomic variants and to relate them to a phenotype. Specifically used for clinical diagnosis.

### [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)
> Genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation. Ensembl annotate genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data. Ensembl tools include BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for all supported species.

### [Human Genome Resources at NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/)
#### ClinVar 
> Link between genome variants and phenotype (namely disease) including the clinical relevance and supported by evidences (publications). 


### [UCSC Genome browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu)
> UCSC ((University of California Santa Cruz), useful bioinformatics tool enabling the visualisation of the genome (of different species) at any scale, completed by a aligned annotations "tracks". The annotions consist for example of gene predictions, mRNA, SNPs.
> includes a broad collection of vertebrate and model organism assemblies and annotations, along with a large suite of tools for viewing, analyzing and downloading data.

## Cancer Related Genome Resources

### [cBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org) 
> Provides visualization, analysis and download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets. Datasets are organised by cancer type. 

### [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) 
> COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer), is the world's largest and most comprehensive resource for exploring the impact of somatic mutations in human cancer It includes two types of data: High precision data and Genome-wide screen data

### [GDC](https://gdc.cancer.gov)
> The GDC T(Genomic Data Commons) unifies data repository for several NCI-sponsored cancer genome programs, including the cancer genome atlas (TCGA).
