- What is CNV/CNA?
  - CNV stands for copy number variation, CNA for copy number aberrations
  - CNV's are found in most types of cancer and have shown to have an impact in cancer development. 


- How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and
so on)?
  - Progenetix is a cancer genome data resource established in 2001, aiming to represent genomic variation profiles in cancer
  - Progenetix provides CNA profiles, data annotations, meta-analysis and visualization
  - The data comes mainly from cancer studies reporting on experiments based on CGH, WES or WGS
  - The database incorporates multiple external data collections, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, GEO and NCBI.
  - The database Vol. 2021 contains over 115000 cancer samples with CNV data of cancer genomes grouped into 51 NCIt nodes such as breast carinoma or Acute Myeloid Leukemia

  
- Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships.
  - NCIt (National Cancer Institute Thesaurus) is a dynamically developed hierachry which allows data transfer between classification systems and resources, it treats diseases as histologic and topographic described entities.
  - ICOD (International Classification of Diseases in Oncology) providing organ- and substructure-specific mapping
  - UBERON is a cross-species anatomical structual ontology system, allowing integrative queries linking multiple databases,linking related organs in an organism and also between e.g model animals and humans
  
- What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them?
  - The CNV segements represent the part of the genome which shows variation in number and the frequency is then used to describe how many of those CNV segements are found in one genome of e.g a tumor.
  
- What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?
  - APIs (application programming interface) provide communication between several computer programs. In Progenetix Beacon is the API used to connect to wanted information in datasets.
  
- How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?
  - Uses for example json documents to give the user the possibility to filter CNA profiles for cancer type, tissue, morphology and more and gives the user visualization options too.
  - As a result one can observe the genome-wide CNA by the percentage of samples, CN gain and loss.
  
Progenetix as a resource for extensive resarch is very powerful, due to the extensive collection of data and the connection between databases.
As CNVs have shown to have a big impact in cancer genomes, a database collecting and providing such information is very crucial.
The standardization processes will surely be ongiong and also challenging but it could become important to further collect research data and to also connect data from all over the world.
