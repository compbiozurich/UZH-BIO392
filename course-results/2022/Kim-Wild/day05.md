Databank to store genome information 

Only has variations in it: \
Prints the position of the base of interest, what base can be found in a comparison genome and the diffrence in the genome of intrest 
good to see transversions \
If thereâ€˜s a deletion in comparison genome two bases are seen and in the one of intrest the base that is left from these two \
For many samples not good, too much data, could be confusing
