## {{ page.title }}

The templates for "categories" and "tags" have been updated, together with changes in the `bootstrap_site.pl` script.

<!--more-->

Templates are now consistently replicated to provide both alphabetically and date sorted listing pages. This means that by running the `bootstrap_site.pl` script, foreach tag or category three listing pages are being generated. Please see the script's [documentation page](/doc/+generated-podmd-doc-ProgenetixTemplate-bootstrap_site/) for more information.
