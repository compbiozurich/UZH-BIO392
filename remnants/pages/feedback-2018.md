### General comments

* command line processing was nice & overall liked
* course site was helpful

### Some improvements suggested by the students:

* lecture slides and course material should be available beforehand
* better announcements of the planned work, with early and clearly communicated links to the resources
* more options to present the course work (and, in minority opinion, get graded for it)
* "real world" research workflow would be nice & engaging (e.g. something the teachers use in their daily routines)

### Teachers' notes

* overall good participation, with surprisingly positive attitude about the "terminal" based exercises
* students were rather "shy" as group, hard to get feedback when asking from the front; however, opening up in one-to-one communication
* room setup a bit inhibitive towards communication; everybody behind large screen... Maybe next time gapped seating w/ rotated screens, of the unused ones
* name signs on tables/screen backs needed (possibly installing some tag holder there?)
* not much of pre-existing "hands on computing" background; maybe next time requesting Github accounts etc. beforehand
