<!--
- These are the activities we will do on Thursday pm and Friday am:
- [NCBI resources activity](https://github.com/compbiozurich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-material/2019/Oct4_activity.pdf) Due date: Oct 4 5pm
- [BLAST and alignment activity](https://github.com/compbiozurich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-material/2019/foxp2lab.pdf) Due date: Oct 4 5pm
- Start working on your presentation by first answering these questions:
1. What is your protein called?
2. What does it do in the cell, where is its location, which biological process is it involved in?
3. Which disease state is it implicated in? 
4. Is this disease a common disease? Rare disease? 
5. Which mutation causes this disease?
6. What type of mutation is this mutation? What is YOUR expectation based on amino acid similarity for the effect of this variation on the protein structure and function?

Next step will be examining the wild type and mutant structures and giving us information about the effect of the variation on the structure.
