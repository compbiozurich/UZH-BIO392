Izaskun Mallona (email: izaskun.mallona at sib.swiss).

### Morning (on site)

We will have two lectures and two sets of exercises (on site).

* Unix + genomic formats lectures (exercises 1-4)
* Unix and genomic formats exercises (5-14)

### Afternoon (online)

We will run the SIB Unix course using a Web browser. We encourage you to run the exercises of the course in a terminal of your own; either on a GNU/Linux or MacOS; or with a Web browser-based emulator of your choice, like [cocalc](https://cocalc.com/app?anonymous=terminal).

* SIB Unix course: [UNIX for Bioinformatics](https://edu.sib.swiss/pluginfile.php/2878/mod_resource/content/4/couselab-html/content.html)
   - Chapter 1: What is UNIX
   - Chapter 2: The UNIX filesystem
   - Chapter 3: UNIX shell - first steps
   - Chapter 4: UNIX shell - filesystem commands
   - Chapter 5: UNIX shell - working with files

### UNIX training

#### Resources

* [UNIX slides](https://github.com/compbiozurich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-material/2020/imallona/1_unix.pdf)
* [Exercises](https://github.com/compbiozurich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-material/2020/imallona/3_exercises.md). Exercises 1-4 cover the basic usage of the terminal (morning). The full set of commands can be found at the SIB Course on UNIX.
* [SIB Course on UNIX (afternoon)](https://edu.sib.swiss/pluginfile.php/2878/mod_resource/content/4/couselab-html/content.html)

### File formats

#### Slides

* [File formats slides](https://github.com/compbiozurich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-material/2020/imallona/2_genomics.pdf)

#### Exercises

Exercises provide a flow of learning by doing. Still, some of them need to be delivered as a report (Due date Sept 26 5pm; see end of the page)

* [Exercises (day 3, morning)](https://github.com/compbiozurich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-material/2020/imallona/3_exercises.md). Exercises 5-14 cover FASTA and FASTQ.

You can launch a terminal in MacOS and GNU/Linux. If running another OS, plese make use a [a Web-browser based emulator](https://cocalc.com/app?anonymous=terminal) or a Linux virtual machine.

#### Cheatsheets:

* [Shell](https://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf)
* [awk](https://gist.github.com/Rafe/3102414)

For extra/advanced reading, please check the following tutorials on bash and awk:

* [Shell](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sh.html)
* [awk](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html)

### Report

Please commit to the BIO392 github a markdown report (due date *Oct 6 5pm*) describing:

- Why do we use the terminal in bioinformatics?

- What is a plain text file?

- In bioinformatics, most of the data are stored in plain text files with added syntax/structure (and commonly compressed afterwards). For instance, fasta or fastq files we have discussed them today, but also SAM, BED, GTF, VCF and others (to be discussed next week). Why is that?

- How can we list files are in a directory? Please provide the command(s).

- What `|` and  `>` do in a terminal?

- How do we print the last 10 lines of the file named `/mnt/test/test.txt`? Please provide the command(s).

- How do we print the first column of the file named `/mnt/test/test.txt` whose columns are separatedby tabs? Please provide the command(s).

- How can we print every third line of a text file? Please provide the command(s), and discuss what they do.

- How can we transform FASTQ into FASTA files using standard Unix tools (sed, awk, etc)? Please provide the command(s), and discuss what they do.
