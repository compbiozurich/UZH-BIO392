## {{ page.title }}

This is a repository for materials related to the BIO392 _Bioinformatics of Sequence Variation_ introductory course at the University of ZÃ¼rich. The course takes place in each Autumn semester (September/October).

### 2020 COVID19 Notes

As per current rules for labs/block courses, BIO392 is held with "in person" attendance. Please follow the UZH [Coronavirus Guidelines](https://www.uzh.ch/en/about/coronavirus/students.html).

Some specific issues for this course:

* masks are required if not enough distancing is possible
* we will limit the "on site" course time, with much of the afternoon part assigned to tasks which can be performed remotely (thereby also enabling lower/mixed occuppancy)
* unfortunately group work has to be limited and "hands on help" has to be reduced - "one person, one "keyboard"
* we have established a chat system through a MS Teams channel - please see OLAT fopr the sign up link

#### Summary

One of the fastest growing areas of bioinformatics is in the analysis, warehousing and representation of genomic and protein sequence variants, particularly with view on the use of molecular data in personalised health and biomedical applications in general. This course will engage participants to explore common data formats, online resources and analysis techniques, with a focus on human genome variation data.
