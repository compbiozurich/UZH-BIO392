CNV(Copy number Variation) oder CNA (Copy Number Aberration) are changes in the genomic structure. Parts of the DNA have different numbers in copy by being duplicated or deleted. They play an important part in cancer development, because most cancer types have CNV/CNA in genes, which influeces the cell cycle. How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)? Progenetix is the largest open cancer genome data bank in the world. There are over 138'000 CNV profiles (over 115'000 are from tumors) from over 1900 studies. Data sources are: GEO, ArrayExpress, TCgA, cBioPortal. Progenetix includes over 788 NClt cancer types. Describe NClt, ICD-O, UBERON codes, and their relationships. NCIT, ICD-O and UBERON codes are different code systems for classification. - NCIT (National Cancer Institute Thesaurus) has a hierarchical ontology structure, which allows more flexible grouping. - ICD-O (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology) codes for topography and morphology of tumors. - UBERON describes ontology of organ and tissues structure systenmatically. Progenetix connects those three classification codes to makes it easier to find the relevant data. What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them? CNV segmentation splits the genome into segments with the same amount of gen copies. This makes it easier to find genome variation (duplication & deletion). CNV frequencies tell how often a specific CNV segment appears in a group. In progenetix CNV segmentation & frequencise are used to detect and analyse common patterns in different cancer types. What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix? APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allows programs to directly use data from data banks. In progenetix Beacon API is used to find specific CNAs in the large data bank. How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles? Progenetix visualise CNA profiles to genome plots, Heatmaps, Distribution graphs and boxplots. Data can be sorted and additional data can be uploaded. What do you think should be imporved in progenetix? The progenetix website could be more user friendly by making it more intuitive. Easier tools or more tutorials how to use the application.","title":"Answers to Progenetix Text"},{"location":"Ayesha-Niramon-Gerber/20250410_Progenetix_paper_Ayesha/#answers-to-progenetix-text","text":"","title":"Answers to Progenetix Text"},{"location":"Ayesha-Niramon-Gerber/20250410_Progenetix_paper_Ayesha/#what-is-cnvcna","text":"CNV(Copy number Variation) oder CNA (Copy Number Aberration) are changes in the genomic structure.

Please change the name of this file to \\<First letter>-\\<Last name>-questions-day-07.md, and upload it to your folder in the course GitHub. These questions will be graded. The most important thing is not that you get everything right, but that you show that you thought about the questions; so no copy/pasting! Practical Q1 Does the sequence quality graph of your data look different from the examples shown in the slides? Are there any adapter sequences in the data? Why do you think this is? Yes. In the example slides boxplots are shwon on top of the sequences quality graph. in our sequence quality graph there are no box plots, because we have a overall quality score of 62 for all 6 sequencinf reads. There are no addapter sequences in the data (except a minimal amount of PolyA). The reason why our quality score is that high, could be because our datas are simulated. There are no uncertainties in sequencing and because of this no lowering in the quality score. Q2 Given the FastQC reports, does it make sense to perform adapter and/or quality-trimming on your data? No. There is almost no adapter content and our quality score is overall perfect. There is no data that has to be trimmed. Q3 Why are so many files in the bioinformatics pipeline compressed and indexed? Because the data size is really big. Q4 In the bash script that processes alignment files, you will see calls to samtools sort, samtools view, and samtools index (among others). Explain what these three programs do. Why do you think each program is needed? Hint: look at the Samtools manual . - samtools sort: sorts alignments by the leftmost coordinate (is needed for later indexing) - samtools view: converts SAM into BAM format & can extract specific reads - samtools index: generates a index data for faster navigation Q5 Explain what files are needed for GangSTR to run. Specifically: explain what information is provided to GangSTR via the --ref, --region, and --bam command line arguments. Hint: look at the GangSTR manual . - --ref is the reference genome (.fa) - --regions the target TR loci (.bed) - --bam the comma separated list of input BAM files. Literature During the practical so far, you have generated variant calls from short read sequencing data using bioinformatics approaches. Now it's time to take a step back and do some background reading in order to prepare for the analysis and interpretation of the results next week. First, read the following sections of this review : * Abstract * Introduction`` * Genotyping STRs from high-throughput sequencing data Then, answer Q6 and Q7. Q6 Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? STRs are some of the fastest mutating loci in the genome and contribute more de novo mutations than any other variant class. They play an important role in regulating gene expression, are often multi-allelic (generate complex inheritance patterns) and are therefore significant contributors to Medelian diseases, complex traits and cancer. Q7 What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? STRs are often filtered from sequencing piplines due to their low quality calls. Reasons for their low quality are: 1. Short reads often do not span entire repeats, effectively reducing the number of informative reads. 2. STR variations present as large insertions or deletions that may be difficult to align to a reference genome and thus indroduce significant mapping bias towards shorter alleles. 3. PCR amplification during library preparation often introduces \"stutter\" noise in the number of repeats at STRs. Second, read the following sections of the paper describing GangSTR : * Abstract * Introduction * Overview of the GangSTR model Then, answer Q8 and Q8. Q8 What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools? GangSTR is an end-to end method that takes sequence alignments and a reference set of TRs as input and outputs estimated diploid repeats length. Its core component is a maximum likelihood framework incorporating various sources of information from short paired-end reads (such as fragment lenth, coverage and existence of partially enclosing reads) into a single model that is applied separately to each TR in the genome. This difference sets GangSTR apart from previous existing tools, which have primarily focused on reapeat-enclosing reads. Q9 What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping? GangSTR incorporates each of these informative aspects of paired-end read alignemnts (see Q8) into a single joint likelihood framework. In the paper they defined 4 classes of paired-end reads: - enclosing read pairs (E): consists of at least one read that contains the entire TR + non-repetitive flanking regions on either end. - spanning read pairs (S): originate from a fragment that completely spans the TR, such that each read in the pair maps on either end of the repeat. - flanking read pairs (F): contain a read that parially extends into the repetitive sequence of a read. - fully repetitive read pairs (FRR): contain at least one read consisting entirely of the TR motif.","title":"BIO392-day-07 Questions"},{"location":"Ayesha-Niramon-Gerber/Ayesha-Gerber-questions-day-07/#bio392-day-07-questions","text":"These questions are designed to test your understanding of the sequence analysis practical and the accompanying literature.

Size estimate was obtained by calculating the bytes of randomly chosen VCF file lines with an online text to bytes calculator. | Evaluation A single page can hold roughly 22 variants, based on an estimated line size of 136 bytes. The VCF format is suitable for storing variants because it contains detailed information like chromosome, position, alleles, quality scores, and annotations. For archival purposes, VCF is effective for variant data as it only contains information about positions differing from the reference and therefore saves space. As it does not store raw sequences or alignments, all information is based on comparison to a reference, requiring a liftover when changing between genome reference editions. In visualization, VCF files enable variant tracks in genome browsers like UCSC or Ensembl . However, being text-based, VCF files require indexing for querying, which can make them less efficient compared to binary VCF formats like BCF (Binary Variant Call Format). BED (Browser Extensible Data) Overview | | | |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Description | Tab-delimited text format for describing genomic intervals (regions, variants) with annotations. | | Best Use | Visualizing genomic intervals | | Size | 69 bytes per line. Size estimate was obtained by calculating the bytes of randomly chosen BED file lines with an online text to bytes calculator. | Evaluation A page can fit approximately 43 regions, based on an estimated line size of 69 bytes. BED is less suited for storing called variants, as it only represents intervals (variant positions or CNVs) without metadata. For archiving, BED's compact structure lacks the annotations needed for comprehensive datasets. BED is best used for visualization in browsers like IGV or UCSC for rendering intervals. Genome browsers like IGV and UCSC can load BED files and use them for highlighting specific regions of the genome.

Size estimate was obtained by reading forums on biostars.org . | Evaluation A page contains approximately 6'000 bases, with an estimated storage size of 0.5 bytes per base for compressed formats like CRAM. As a whole human exome contains about 30 million bp, a BAM file for the human exome would contain 5'000 pages. BAM is unsuitable for storing called variants directly, as it holds raw or aligned reads used to generate VCFs. It is best used in archiving for preserving full alignment data for re-analysis, such as new variant calling. For visualization, BAM is suitable for visualization of reads in browsers like IGV, but its size makes it less efficient for variant visualization compared to BED.

Size estimate was obtained by reading forums on biostars.org . | Evaluation In a FASTA file, approximately 3'000 bases can fit per page, with an estimated storage size of 1 byte per base. FASTA is not suitable for storing variant data, as it only holds raw sequences without annotations. It is used as a format for reference genomes and raw or assembled sequences. While FASTA is most commonly used to store reference genomes like GRCh38 , it is also used to archive assembled contigs from sequencing experiments. In visualization, FASTA provides the reference sequence used in genome browsers, but it cannot display variant positions or annotations directly.

What are the benefits of the T2T genome when analyzing genomic data? Why is the T2T genome not a classical reference genome? How does the pangenome address the limitations of the T2T genome to build a true reference genome? References Unless otherwise specified, all information is derived from the paper of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, 2023 and the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium, 2022 . Pangenome and T2T T2T revolution In 2022, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium published the first complete human genome, including heterochromatic regions that account for approximately 8% of the genome. This assembly is called T2T-CHM13 and includes nearly 200 million additional base pairs (3.055 Gbp in total) compared to the GRCh38 reference genome, released by the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) in 2013. GRCh38 relied on bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) cloning, which is not well-suited for sequencing heterochromatin, centromeres, telomeres, and repetitive regions, resulting in missing regions and a genome-wide deletion bias which is typical for partial assemblies. To overcome these problems, the T2T Consortium used long-read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio HiFi, to assemble the genome from a homozygous CHM13hTERT female human cell line which represents a functionally haploid genome. Reanalysis of the 1000 Genomes Project (1KG) sequences using T2T-CHM13 revealed more copy number variants (CNVs) than GRCh38 and identified approximately 3.7 million additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). T2T is not a reference genome In contrast to GRCh38, T2T-CHM13 is not a classical reference genome because it originates from a single individual's cell line. Reference genomes like GRCh38 are mosaics of sequences from multiple individuals to better represent intraspecific diversity. While T2T-CHM13 enables more accurate read alignments and improved variant detection in repetitive regions it lacks the diversity representation of a true reference. To address this issue, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) aimed to assemble genomes of multiple individuals with diverse population backgrounds in order to create a mosaic pangenome. The pangenome is a graph of many T2T assemblies In 2023, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) published the first draft of the human pangenome reference, containing sequences from 47 individuals representing diverse population backgrounds . Just like the T2T project, the HPRC also used long-read sequencing, such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio HiFi, to capture repetitive regions. The assemblies achieved a quality comparable to those of the T2T project, covering 99% of the individuals' genomes with 99% base calling accuracy. By aligning these assemblies, the HPRC created a pangenome reference that reflects known variants and haplotypes. Compared to GRCh38, the pangenome adds 119 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1'115 gene duplications, with approximately 90 million of these bases derived from structural variations (SVs). This improves short-read (derived from Illumina sequencing) analysis, reducing small variant discovery errors by 34% and improving structural variant detection by 104% relative to GRCh38. Previous studies have identified tens of megabases of polymorphic SVs within populations, noting that reference genomes from a single population miss over two-thirds of these SVs. Such bias is detrimental, as SVs are more likely to impact gene function than SNPs or short indels and their detection could be of high significance for diagnostics. The pangenome reference graph circumvents this limitation by representing multiple populations. A near-term application of the pangenome could be the improvement of reference-based sequence mapping workflows. Despite its complexity, pangenome mapping is still computationally efficient and provides the benefit of reducing variant calling errors and improving transcript mapping accuracy compared to GRCh38. While genotyping SVs from short-read samples is challenging with standard references, the pangenome enables more accurate and sensitive genotyping which could allow the reanalysis of existing short-read datasets. Combining long-read sequencing with the pangenome reference will further improve SV genotyping and could become a preferred approach for read mapping in SV and CNV detection.","title":"Asssignment by Basil Burri"},{"location":"Basil-Burri/Assignment_Pangenome-T2T_BaBurri/#asssignment-by-basil-burri","text":"","title":"Asssignment by Basil Burri"},{"location":"Basil-Burri/Assignment_Pangenome-T2T_BaBurri/#questions-addressed-in-this-assignment","text":"How does the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) genome assembly differ from previous genome constructions?

These questions will be graded. The most important thing is not that you get everything right, but that you show that you thought about the questions; so no copy/pasting! Practical Q1 Does the sequence quality graph of your data look different from the examples shown in the slides? Are there any adapter sequences in the data? Why do you think this is? The sequence quality graph does not show any quality scores for the reads, assuming all sequences have the same non-assigned quality. This makes sense because the simulated data was specifically designed without quality scores. Inlcuding quality scores would simulate more real-world data. There are also no adapter sequences in the data, as adapters are used during actual sequencing, and there was no need to include adapter sequences in this simulated dataset. Q2 Given the FastQC reports, does it make sense to perform adapter and/or quality-trimming on your data? The absence of quality scores and adapter sequences means that no quality or adapter trimming is needed in this exercise. The sequence quality graph and the average sequence length therefore do not change, as no trimming will be performed. In a real-world sequencing experiment, one would have to remove reads with lower quality and cut away adapter sequences. This would generally lead to fewer reads (but increased average quality) and shorter reads. Q3 Why are so many files in the bioinformatics pipeline compressed and indexed? Bioinformatics files like FASTA or SAM are large, as they are text-based formats. Compressed formats like FASTA.gz (compressed FASTA) or BAM (binary, compressed version of SAM) save storage space. Indexing, such as with samtools faidx for FASTA or using BAI indexing with samtools view for BAM, enables more efficient querying of specific genomic regions without reading the entire file. This \"random access\" facilitates faster processing in tools analyzing large datasets. In our exercise, GangSTR requires the reference genome to have an index generated by samtools to allow rapid access to tandem repeat regions. Q4 In the bash script that processes alignment files, you will see calls to samtools sort, samtools view, and samtools index (among others). Explain what these three programs do. Why do you think each program is needed? Hint: look at the Samtools manual . samtools sort sorts alignments by the leftmost coordinates. By specifying options, other sort orders are possible (e.g. -n: sorted by read name, -t: sorted by tag). In our exercise, we used the default options to sort alignments by the leftmost coordinates, which is necessary for indexing. samtools view prints all alignments in the specified input alignment file to standard output in SAM format. By specifying options, the command can convert the output from SAM to BAM or CRAM (--bam: convert to BAM, --cram: convert to CRAM). In our exercise, we used the option --bam to compress the alignments into the BAM format. samtools index indexes a coordinate-sorted BAM or CRAM file for fast random access. BAM and CRAM files use BGZF compression and indexing creates a BAI file to support region-specific queries. Indices are needed when arguments limit samtools view or similar commands to particular regions of interest. In our exercise, after converting the SAM file to BAM with samtools view --bam , we used samtools index to index the alignments, to allow random data access for GangSTR. Q5 Explain what files are needed for GangSTR to run. Specifically: explain what information is provided to GangSTR via the --ref, --regions, and --bam command line arguments. Hint: look at the GangSTR manual . Needed files for GangSTR GangSTR requires a BAM file of short read alignments, a reference set of TRs, and a reference genome, and outputs genotypes in a VCF file. File Type Purpose Notes BAM file Contains short read alignments for a sample Produced by an indel-sensitive aligner, must be sorted and indexed. FASTA reference genome Reference genome used for alignment and genotyping Must be the same reference build used to align the sequences in the BAM file to prevent alignment errors or misgenotyping, especially for repetitive STR regions. BED-like TR regions file Defines regions of tandem repeats (TRs) to be genotyped BED-like file with columns: Chromosome name, start position, end position, motif length, repeat motif. Information provided to GangSTR by options Argument File Type Description --bam BAM file Specifies the input short read alignment file. One sample per file. Must be sorted and indexed. --ref FASTA reference genome Specifies the reference genome used for aligning reads and genotyping. Must match the BAM's reference. --regions BED-like TR regions file Specifies the tandem repeat regions to analyze. Each entry defines a repeat region to genotype. Literature During the practical so far, you have generated variant calls from short read sequencing data using bioinformatics approaches. Now it's time to take a step back and do some background reading in order to prepare for the analysis and interpretation of the results next week. First, read the following sections of this review : * Abstract * Introduction * Genotyping STRs from high-throughput sequencing data Q6 Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? STRs are multiallelic and contribute more de novo mutations than any other variant class. The high mutation rate is due to their repetitive nature, which induces slippage events during DNA replication. Many repeat disorders follow autosomal dominant inheritance patterns, but as STRs lead to de novo mutations in every new generation and are often multiallelic, they may lead to complex, non-Mendelian inheritance patterns. STRs also play a role in regulating gene expression and other molecular phenotypes. STRs modulate gene expression and function in health and disease by forming transcription factor binding sites, affecting spacing between regulatory elements, inducing unusual DNA secondary structures such as Z-DNA, or modulating epigenetic properties such as DNA methylation and heterochromatinization. STRs may also mediate effects at the RNA and protein level by modulating alternative splicing through RNA secondary structure, affecting RNA protein binding sites, or forming toxic RNA and protein aggregates. Illustration of the modulations by STRs Q7 What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? PCR-induced stutter: PCR amplification introduces \"stutter\" artifacts, causing variations in the number of repeats in sequencing reads, which complicates genotyping. Local sequence alignment: Standard alignment tools struggle with repeats, leading to inconsistent alignments due to multiple possible best alignments of short reads that do not capture the entire repeat. Low-quality calls: STRs are often filtered out from sequencing pipelines due to unreliable genotyping. Therefore they are often not included in analyses like variant calling or GWAS. High mutation rates and multiallelic nature of STRs: STRs cause high mutation rates due to polymerase slippage during replication, and their multiallelic nature creates complex, non-Mendelian inheritance patterns. This nature of STRs makes them difficult to analyze with traditional linkage or bi-allelic SNP-based methods. Second, read the following sections of the paper describing GangSTR : * Abstract * Introduction * Overview of the GangSTR model Q8 What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools? GangSTR performes better in genome-wide STR genotyping using NGS data compared to tools like LobSTR, HipSTR, ExpansionHunter, Tredparse, exSTRa, and STRetch. Broader genotyping range: Accurately genotypes short and expanded TRs, including those exceeding read or fragment length, unlike LobSTR and HipSTR (which are limited to short TRs) or ExpansionHunter and Tredparse (which do not work well with long alleles). Integrative model: Integrates multiple paired-end read properties (enclosing, spanning, flanking, fully repetitive reads, coverage, fragment length) into a maximum likelihood framework, unlike exSTRa (which provides no length estimates) or STRetch (limited to 6 bp motifs). Scalability: Optimized for genome-wide analysis, unlike Tredparse and ExpansionHunter, which focus on targeted pathogenic expansions. Accuracy and speed: Outperforms many tools in accuracy and speed for genome-wide STR genotyping, providing unbiased TR length estimates for GWAS and novel variant discovery. Validated discoveries: Identifies novel TR expansions in healthy individuals, validated by long-read sequencing and capillary electrophoresis, which is not possible with other genome-wide STR genotyping tools like LobSTR and HipSTR. Q9 What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping? GangSTR is an end-to-end method that requires sequence alignments and a reference set of TRs as input and outputs estimated diploid repeat lengths. GangSTR uses multiple paired-end short read (from NGS) properties in its maximum likelihood framework, including read depth and allele-specific information to refine genotyping accuracy. Enclosing Reads: Fully contain TR and flanking regions \u2192 directly counting repeats Spanning Reads: Span TR, with reads in flanking regions \u2192 informing TR length via fragment size Flanking Reads: Partially extend into TR \u2192 supporting length estimation Fully Repetitive Reads (FRR): Consist entirely of the TR motif \u2192 indicating TRs longer than the read length Coverage and Fragment Length: Incorporates sequencing coverage, read depth, and fragment length distribution \u2192 estimate TR lengths, especially for long alleles Illustration of the different read properties","title":"Assignment by Basil Burri"},{"location":"Basil-Burri/B-Burri-questions-day-07/#assignment-by-basil-burri","text":"These questions are designed to test your understanding of the sequence analysis practical and the accompanying literature.

WES WES = Whole Exome Sequencing - Definition : It sequences only the exons of the genome, which are the protein-coding regions. They only make up a fraction (~1.5%) of the whole genome. - This allows the detection of mutation in coding genes associated with many diseases. - Advantages : cheap and fast, smaller data files needed, reduced complexity. - Disadvantages : it misses non-coding regions, which can also have an influence on diseases. WGS WGS = Whole Genome Sequencing - Definition : It sequences the whole entire genome . - This allows detection of most genetic variation. - Advantages : Unbiased and thorough, more useful for SV and rare variants - Disadvantages : higher cost and data volume, difficult analysis and storage. What are the different file formats? What are they and why are they important? \\ Which formats to use for what purpose? SAM SAM = Sequence Alignment/Map \\ It is a text-based format for storing sequence alignment data. It contains info like alignment position, read quality and flags. - Advantages : detailed and extensive, human-readable - Disadvantages : large file size (due to verbose formatting: includes read name, alignment info, flags, quality scores, etc.) BAM BAM = Binary Alignment Map (compressed version of SAM) \\ It too provides information about how sequenced reads align to a reference genome. \\ It aims to make storage and access to the alignments more efficient. - Advantages : smaller/more compact than SAM, more computationally efficient - Disadvantages : still large file size I would probably use this for full archival purposes , because it is good for long-term storage, is smaller than SAM and more complete than VCF.\\ I would also use this for browser visualisation . VCF VCF = Variant Call Format \\ It stores genetic variants, like SNPs, insertions, deletions. It only describes the differences between sample genome and reference genome for around 2500 samples. - Advantages : Compact and tab-delimited, stores many samples, each variant is only represented once - Disadvantages : complex, doesn't store actual sequence reads, there are many empty columns - Storage : the human genome has ~5 mio variants per WGS (~0.16% of the total 3 billion bp), therefore, VCF files need less storage It is best for genotyping results and clinical analysis. Therefore best for storing called variants and together with BAM for browser visualisation . FASTA = linear annotation of single-letter nucleotides or amino acid codes It is a text-based sequence storage, that stores the raw nucleotide sequences of DNA/RNA or proteins. \\ It can act as a reference genome or be used just as assembled sequences. - Advantages : Simple and human-readable, used as reference for alignments. - Disadvantages : No quality (can be extended to FASTQ though), large (not optimised for size or compression) and inefficient. - Storage : - 3 bio bases * 1 byte = 3 GB - 1000 Genomes: 3 TB I would use this for browser visualisation and full archival purposes as the reference genome.

It contains 47 phased, diploid assemblies from genetically divers individuals.\\ Though it's impossible for one genome like T2T-CHM13 to represent the genetic diversity of our species, it is a step in the right direction. \\ Now to overcome not only this but also the reference bias that comes hand in hand with this, it is better to switch to a pangenome. Said pangenome is supposed to better capture global genomic diversity. Achievements It adds 119 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1'115 gene duplications in comparison to the previous existing reference. It covers more than 99% of expected sequence with high accuracy. It reduced small variant discovery errors by 34%. It can faithfully recapitulate the existing knowledge of medically relevant loci. This will enable future efforts to study the role of compley variation in human disease. It enables more accurate SV (structural variant) detection and can identify new haplotypes in complex genomic regions. What makes the T2T approach different from previous reference genome constructions? It combines multiple sequencing methods and it completes the 8% that have been missing in previous reference genomes. It increases the number of known genes and repeats in the human genome through introducing 182 Mbp of missing sequence. They sequenced CHM13 extensively and repeatedly with multiple technologies (e.g. HiFi and ONT). Following this, they assembled, validated and polished the genome and finished the remaining problematic regions including the centromeric regions, the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes and human ribosomal DNA. Before, there was an underrepresentation of repetitive sequences, which where unsolvable. GRCh38 contained 151 Mbp of unknown sequence and regions that are artificial or otherwise incorrect. Although the Nanopore sequencing (ONT) was able to solve a lot of problems, it still had a relatively high error rate. Moreover, the error-rate of T2T-CHM13 is 1 error per 10 Mbp which exceeds the historical standard of \"finished\" sequence. What future benefit for genome data analysis can the T2T/pangenome approach attribute? Challenges & areas of improvements/limitations It is still an active research area, because you still face computational challenges (the incredible amount of sequences you have to align) and how you decide which alignments should be included. Additionally, further work will be required in multiple aspects, one area being to better identify medically relevant complex SVs. Reference-based sequence mapping needs to be improved. Analysis with more samples is required. They are planning to expand the pangenome to 350 individuals, which should capture the most common variants. This using the T2T approach. There still are sequencing errors. Aims & Outlook Improve downstream analysis workflows by removing mapping biases (that arise when working with only one reference genome, such as GRCh38 or CHM13) Improve the accuracy of calling small variants from short reads. Work together with low-cost long-read sequencing for comprehensive SV genotyping. It should benefit individuals of different ancestries differently. It aims to improve our understanding of genomics and our ability to predict, diagnose and treat disease. E.g. through precision medicine. The methods could also prove valuable for other species.

What is CNV/CNA? CNV stands for copy number variants They originate from changes in copy number in germline cells. It is the number of copies of a particular gene that varies from one individual to other individuals. CNA stands for copy number abberations They are somatic changes to chromosome structure that result in gain or loss in copies of sections of DNA. So structural genome variations in copy number that have arisen in somatic tissue and are nearly ubiquitous in cancer. Both can arise from deletions, insertions, or duplications resulting in chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy. They help researchers disentangle molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and identify & characterise molecular subtypes of cancer. 2. How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)? Progenetix is a publicly accessible cancer genome data resource with a focus on individual genome-wide CNA profiles. It provides: an overview of mutation data in cancer, through providing sample-specific CNA profiles and associated metadata, services related to data annotation, meta-analysis and visualisation. It incorporates data from CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridisation), that was focused on molecular cytogenetics, with WGS/WES, that were more focused on whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing. \\ Recently it introduced also data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which was used to the majority for deposition of data.\\ Other resources include ArrayExpress, cBioPortal and TCGA. The data is based on individual sample data from currently 138'663 samples taken from published oncogenomic studies and data repositories. This includes 5764 samples corresponding to 2162 different cancer cell lines, representing 259 different cancer types. In total the progenetix resource contains data of 834 different cancer types (NCIt neoplasm classification), mapped to a variety of biological and technical categories. The scale for the cancer-types are rather big (such as lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer types, brain cancer, breast cancer, etc.). 3. Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships NCIt = National Cancer Institute Thesaurus NCIt is a dynamically developed hierarchical ontology. It makes layered data aggregation and transfer between classification systems and resources possible. ICD-O = International Classification of Diseases in Oncology Used for cancer sample classification and provides organ- and substructure-specific mapping. It is limited to hierarchical concepts and is hard to apply to modern ontologies. The combination of the ICD-O Morphology and Topography coding systems depicts diagnostic entities with high specificity. Progenetix performed \"ICD-O\u2014NCIt\" mappings that allow us, by adding the derived NCIt codes, to take advantage of NCIt\u2019s hierarchical structure for data retrieval, analysis and exchange. UBERON = cross-species anatomical structural ontology system It is closely aligned with developmental processes. It allows integrative queries linking multiple databases. All existing ICD-O T codes have been mapped to UBERON terms. 4. What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how can they be used? CNV segmentations represent the part of the genome which shows variation in number and it can be used to identify CNVs associated with certain cell types. CNV frequencies represent the occurrence of certain copy number variations within a population or data set.\\ Divide the genome into 1Mb-size bins and then count the occurrences of gain/loss events for all bins in the selected samples. An individual can use CNV segmentations with filter options for cancer type, tissue location, morphology, cell line or geographic location. 5. What are APIs and how are you to use APIs in progenetix? API = Application Programming Interfaces They are a set of rules, protocols and tools for building software applications, which allows different software systems to communicate with each other. It enables data exchange, allows integration between software systems and provides a standardised way for applications to request and share information. It can be described as the \"language\" one has to use to communicate with progenetix. 6. How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles? CNA profiles are visualized as a genomwide plot displaying the percentage of samples with copy number gain in yellow and samples with copy number loss in blue. It will include all samples fitting your specific search. E.g. selected chromosomal regions and grouping by subsets or studies. Additionally, you obtain: Cancer type classifications sorted by frequency on the matched biosamples present in the subset. A list of matched biosamples with description, statistics and reference. Matched variants with reference to biosamples. 7. What do you think should be improved in progenetix? Increase the amount of data with constant updates from new studies. Connect data from all over the world and prioritise the validity of the data. Always keep in mind to create a simple and accessible website, that can be used intuitively.

Copy Number Variations/Copy Number Aberrations : specific sequence repeats in the genome that vary between individuals. It is a form of structural variation and can be important in cancer development and progression. Sections of DNA can be duplicated or deleted. How will you describe or introduce Progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)? Progenetix is a derived database that focuses on CNVs and provides mutation data related to cancer. The individual sample data is curated from different sources, with the majority coming from genomic arrays from SNP platforms, as well as from CGH experiments and whole genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES) studies. As of now, the database includes 156,871 samples across 906 distinct cancer types . This open resource offers key features such as local CNV aberrations, as well as CNV cancer profiles and annotated references to research articles about cancer genome screening experiments. Describe NCIt, ICDO, UBERON codes, and their relationships. ICD-O:International Classification of Diseases in Oncology is classification system combining morphology and tooplogy. While it captures diagnostic entities in great detail, it lacks a hierarchical organization.\\ NCIt: National Cancer Institute thesaurus is a hierarchical ontology, which provides a structured, hierarchical classification of cancer types, giving cancer samples an NCIt code and creating an \"NCIt hierarchy tree\". In Progenetix (as of 2021), ICD-O--NCIt mappings were generated to add the NCIt codes to all the samples, combine the two systems together. \\ UBERON: Uber-anatomy ontology \"is a cross-species anatomical structural ontology system\". This can standardize anatomical terms across humans and model organisms, by linking multiple databases (Gene Ontology, Protein Ontology etc). Progenetix (as of 2021) mapped all ICD-O topography codes to the UBERON terms. What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies and how to use them? CNV segmentations represent regions of the genome that are consistently altered in copy number within individul samples. CNV segmentations are great to analyse CNV data on the sample level, to see what genes are altered. CNV frequencies give the count of how often specific genomic regions are altered across many samples. CNV frequencies are valuable for identifying cancer types or subtypes and for detecting CNV alterations that are frequently observed in cancer. What are APIs and how to use APIs in Progenetix? Application Programming Interfaces: \"set of routines, protocols and tools that specifies how software components interact, to exchange data and processing capabilities\" This is a way you can access databases. \\ ~ Definition from BIO390:Lecture 1 \\ One way Progenetix uses APIs is with Beacon+ API . With Beacon, which was created by the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health (GA4GH) to make genomic data discoverable via APIs. bycon is the open-source that then runs the APIs on the Progenetix website. Based on the Beacon v2 standard, Progenetix's API lets users search for variants, filter by cancer type etc, query by location and many more things. \\ Progenetix also has Services API , which also is built on bycon , but offers more specialized outputs like plots, convert biological names (like cytobands), get data about geographic locations (cities but also gene coordinates).\\ Beacon+ API is for structured genomic queries, whereas Services API is for utility and transformation tools. How does Progenetix visualize CNA profiles? CNV Histogram Plots: These plots display copy number variation (CNV) frequencies across genomic regions. The x-axis represents the genomic positions on the chromosome(s). The y-axis represents the CNV frequency, so the percentage of samples showing gain (yellow) or loss (blue) at each x position. You can generate these plots for: a specific gene of interest (to explore CNVs affecting that gene) A cancer type or subtype (to identify common alterations across a cohort) In R, the function pgxFreqplot() from the pgxRpi package can generate equivalent plots. Additionally, Progenetix also makes Sample Strip Plots. These plots display individual sample CNV profiles, with each strip representing a single sample. What do you think should be improved in Progenetix? In general, creating additional CNV visualizations\u2014such as clustering maps to explore CNV patterns across different cancer types\u2014would be valuable and interesting. Including transcriptomic and methylation data could improve the interpretation of CNVs and help connect findings to epigenetic mechanisms. Constantly increasing the representation of samples from diverse ancestral and geographic backgrounds would enhance the datasets' inclusivity. It might also be beneficial to establish a relationship between NCIt and UBERON, as many NCIt cancer types include anatomical references that could be mapped to UBERON terms (e.g., breast carcinoma \u2192 mammary gland). But connecting NCIt to ICD-O and ICD-O to UBERON might be sufficient enough. In addition, leveraging UBERON to create a body-wide anatomical map to visually highlight CNV gains and losses across different organs, could be an interesting way to explore cancer-related alterations visually.

Hint: look at the Samtools manual . - sort: sorts alignments in a BAM file by genomic coordinates --> this makes an ordered BAM - view: converts all alignments in files like (BAM or CRAM) to a standard output in SAM format, or vice versa. - index: creates a .bai index file, which enables random access to specific genomic regions Why all three are needed: 1.

Now it's time to take a step back and do some background reading in order to prepare for the analysis and interpretation of the results next week. First, read the following sections of this review : * Abstract * Introduction`` * Genotyping STRs from high-throughput sequencing data Then, answer Q6 and Q7. Q6 Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? \\ STRs make up approximately 3% of the human genome and contribute significantly to human genetic variation due to their high mutation rates. STRs are also connected to various diseases. One well-known example is Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions. STRs can influence phenotypes through multiple mechanisms, including effects on gene function and regulation (such as DNA hypermethylation and transcription factor binding) as well as through transcribed and translated repeat elements: for instance, impacting alternative splicing, or leading to toxic RNA and protein aggregates. Q7 What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? \\ STRs are often longer than standard read lengths, which reduces the number of informative reads, as short reads often do not span the entire repeat region. Additionally, STR variations can involve large insertions or deletions (INDELs), which are difficult to align accurately to a reference genome, increasing mapping bias toward shorter alleles. As with any PCR amplification, stutter noise can occur, leading to incorrect estimation of repeat lengths. Second, read the following sections of the paper describing GangSTR : * Abstract * Introduction * Overview of the GangSTR model Then, answer Q6 and Q7. Q8 What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools? \\ GangSTR, a novel method for genome-wide analysis, can genotype both short and expanded tandem repeats (TRs) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Unlike many existing tools, GangSTR is not limited by sequencing fragment length and is capable of accurately analyzing highly repetitive regions of the genome. It leverages information from multiple classes of paired-end reads and integrates them into a unified model to estimate maximum likelihood TR lengths. According to the paper, GangSTR achieves higher accuracy and greater speed than other tools. Comparison with other tools mentioned in the paper: \\ exSTRa: does not estimate repeat length, which is important for assessing disease severity. \\ STRetch: cannot analyze short TRs (with motifs up to 6 bp). \\ Tredparse: cannot estimate repeat lengths longer than the sequencing fragment length and does not scale to genome-wide analysis. \\ ExpansionHunter: less accurate when both alleles are close in size or longer than the fragment length; does not scale well genome-wide. \\ Long-read technologies (third-generation sequencing): lower per-base accuracy, higher indel rates, and higher cost. Q9 What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping? \\ GangSTR requires sequence alignments and a tandem repeat (TR) reference set to estimate diploid repeat lengths as the output. GangSTR utilizes paired-end sequencing reads to inform its genotyping model. Paired-end reads are categorized into four classes: enclosing read pairs, spanning read pairs, flanking read pairs, and fully repetitive read pairs. - Enclosing reading pairs: contain the entire TR + flanking regions - Spanning reading paris: each read maps to opposite flanks of the STR, which indicates distance and expansion - Flanking reading pairs: partly overlap the repeat and give insight into its boundaries. - Fully repetitive pairs: consist entirely of repeat sequence, which help detect larger expansions.","title":"BIO392-day-07 Questions"},{"location":"Marieluisa-Buchegger/questions_day_07/#bio392-day-07-questions","text":"These questions are designed to test your understanding of the sequence analysis practical and the accompanying literature.

Some may be harmless in one group but harmful in another. A diverse map helps distinguish between benign and pathogenic CNVs and improves clinical diagnosis. 2. What is the CNV size that the authors defined? CNVs are defined as DNA segments larger than 50 base pairs (bp). This is the threshold used in this study. 3. What are the primary approaches used for CNV detection? What are their advantages and limitations? Microarrays (CGH, SNP arrays): Good for finding duplications, but may miss small or complex CNVs. Next-generation sequencing (NGS): Very sensitive and accurate, but may miss duplications and is computationally heavy. 4. What are the two criteria for cluster filtering? Why?

Are there any adapter sequences in the data? Why do you think this is? The sequence quality graph looks very different from typical real data examples. A drop in the average quality score across all reads toward the end of the read is common in real data (due to sequencing chemistry issues). However, instead of variation in base quality across the read length, there is a single, constant quality score of 62 across all positions. According to Feifei, this is unrealistically perfect and indicates that the data was simulated rather than generated by an actual sequencer. FastQC shows: \"Adapter Content\" passed, meaning no adapter sequences were detected, because this dataset was artificially generated. Most other quality checks also passed (except GC content, which often fails in simulated data due to lack of natural variability). Q2 Given the FastQC reports, does it make sense to perform adapter and/or quality-trimming on your data? Trimming is not necessary in this case. There are no low-quality regions to remove. No adapter contamination is present. Q3 Why are so many files in the bioinformatics pipeline compressed and indexed? Genomic datasets are huge. To handle them, - Compression reduces file size, saving disk space and speeding up data transfer. - Indexing enables fast random access to specific regions of large files without having to read the entire file. Without compression and indexing, analyses would be slower and more memory-intensive. In our exercise, the files in the directory ~/project-day-07/data/reference/ are: APC.fa: Reference genome (FASTA file) APC.fa.fai: Used by samtools faidx to quickly fetch sequences from large FASTA files. APC.fa.* (amb, ann, bwt, pac, 0123): Used by bwa to align reads to the genome efficiently. Q4 In the bash script that processes alignment files, you will see calls to samtools sort, samtools view, and samtools index (among others). Explain what these three programs do. Why do you think each program is needed? Hint: look at the Samtools manual . * samtools view Converts a .sam file (text format) into a .bam file (binary format), making the file smaller and faster to process. samtools sort Sorts the .bam file by the genomic coordinates, being required by many downstream tools (e.g. for variant calling). samtools index Creates an index (.bai file) for the .bam file, allowing fast random access to specific regions in the file. Q5 Explain what files are needed for GangSTR to run. Specifically: explain what information is provided to GangSTR via the --ref, --region, and --bam command line arguments. Hint: look at the GangSTR manual . --ref File: APC.fa (reference genome) provides the genomic sequence that reads were aligned to. GangSTR uses this to determine where the STRs (Short Tandem Repeats) are located and to interpret read alignments correctly. --regions File: APC_repeats.tsv contains the coordinates and repeat motifs of known STR regions in the reference genome. GangSTR uses it to focus its genotyping only on these specified regions (instead of scanning the entire genome). --bam File: patient_X.bam (e.g. patient_1.bam, patient_2.bam, ...) contains the aligned sequencing reads from a sample. GangSTR analyzes the reads in relation to the reference and the STR regions to estimate the number of repeat units (genotyping). GangSTR outputs: *.vcf.gz: STR genotypes in VCF format samplestats.tab: summary stats for the sample insdata.tab: detailed info on insertions Literature During the practical so far, you have generated variant calls from short read sequencing data using bioinformatics approaches. Now it's time to take a step back and do some background reading in order to prepare for the analysis and interpretation of the results next week. First, read the following sections of this review : * Abstract * Introduction`` * Genotyping STRs from high-throughput sequencing data Then, answer Q6 and Q7. Q6 Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? STR variation is relevant to health and disease because it contributes significantly to human genetic variation and is implicated in a variety of disorders. STR expansions are known to cause conditions such as Fragile X Syndrome and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, and have been linked to mechanisms like polyglutamine aggregation, hypermethylation, RNA toxicity, and abnormal translation processes. Smaller STR variants can also affect gene regulation and RNA splicing, as seen in progressive myoclonus epilepsy and cystic fibrosis. Additionally, STRs are predicted to contribute more de novo mutations per generation than any other variant type, suggesting a potential role in spontaneous diseases like autism and neurodevelopmental disorders. Q7 What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? - Short reads often do not span the full repeat regions, reducing informativeness. - STR variations can appear as large insertions or deletions, causing alignment difficulties and biases toward shorter alleles. - PCR amplification can introduce stutter noise, complicating accurate repeat count determination. - Standard sequencing pipelines often filter out STRs due to low-quality calls, and even known pathogenic repeats may go undetected. - Many genotyping tools struggle with low complexity regions and require specialized algorithms to mitigate mapping biases and model errors. Second, read the following sections of the paper describing GangSTR : * Abstract * Introduction * Overview of the GangSTR model Then, answer Q6 and Q7. Q8 What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools? GangSTR stands out from other tools because it is designed for genome-wide genotyping of both short and expanded tandem repeats (TRs) using a unified maximum likelihood framework that integrates multiple sources of information from paired-end reads, enabling it to accurately estimate diploid repeat lengths across a broad spectrum of repeat sizes. It also outperforms other methods in both accuracy and speed, and it does not require a control cohort, unlike some other tools. Q9 What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping? GangSTR uses four classes of paired-end read data: - Enclosing reads (E): reads that span the entire repeat with flanking regions. - Spanning reads (S): pairs where reads map to either side of the repeat. - Flanking reads (F): reads that partially extend into the repeat. - Fully Repetitive Reads (FRR): reads composed entirely of the repeat motif. For each class, GangSTR models specific characteristics such as repeat count, observed fragment length, distance from the repeat region, and number of observed copies, integrating this data into a maximum likelihood model to estimate the diploid genotype.","title":"BIO392-day-07 Questions"},{"location":"Megumi-Mizoguchi/M-Mizoguchi_questions_day_07/#bio392-day-07-questions","text":"","title":"BIO392-day-07 Questions"},{"location":"Megumi-Mizoguchi/M-Mizoguchi_questions_day_07/#practical","text":"","title":"Practical"},{"location":"Megumi-Mizoguchi/M-Mizoguchi_questions_day_07/#q1","text":"Does the sequence quality graph of your data look different from the examples shown in the slides? Are there any adapter sequences in the data? Why do you think this is? The sequence quality graph looks very different from typical real data examples. A drop in the average quality score across all reads toward the end of the read is common in real data (due to sequencing chemistry issues). However, instead of variation in base quality across the read length, there is a single, constant quality score of 62 across all positions. According to Feifei, this is unrealistically perfect and indicates that the data was simulated rather than generated by an actual sequencer. FastQC shows: \"Adapter Content\" passed, meaning no adapter sequences were detected, because this dataset was artificially generated. Most other quality checks also passed (except GC content, which often fails in simulated data due to lack of natural variability).","title":"Q1"},{"location":"Megumi-Mizoguchi/M-Mizoguchi_questions_day_07/#q2","text":"Given the FastQC reports, does it make sense to perform adapter and/or quality-trimming on your data?

Genomic datasets are huge. To handle them, - Compression reduces file size, saving disk space and speeding up data transfer. - Indexing enables fast random access to specific regions of large files without having to read the entire file. Without compression and indexing, analyses would be slower and more memory-intensive. In our exercise, the files in the directory ~/project-day-07/data/reference/ are: APC.fa: Reference genome (FASTA file) APC.fa.fai: Used by samtools faidx to quickly fetch sequences from large FASTA files.

The Progenetix oncogenomic resource in 2021 . Database (Oxford). 2021 Jul 17;2021:baab043. doi: 10.1093/database/baab043. PMID: 34272855; PMCID: PMC8285936. 1. What is CNV/CNA? CNV (Copy Number Variation) and CNA (Copy Number Aberration) are structural mutations in which a specific region of genomic DNA is present in greater (amplified) or lesser (deleted) amounts than usual. CNVs can be part of the normal variation in the human genome but often have pathological significance in cancer. CNA is a term used to refer to an abnormal form of CNV found specifically in cancer cells. CNA represents extensive structural variations in the genome that have a functional impact on cancer development. 2. How will you describe or introduce Progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)? Progenetix is a publicly accessible cancer genome data resource that provides sample-specific CNA profiles, associated metadata, and services related to data annotation, meta-analysis, and visualization. Scale: As shown in Table 1, the resource includes 1,939 studies, 138,663 samples, 788 NCIt classifications, 115,359 cancer loci, and 5,764 samples corresponding to 2,162 different cancer cell lines. Data sources: These include the previously separate arrayMap data collection as well as external resources such as TCGA, cBioPortal, NCBI\u2019s GEO, and EMBL-EBI\u2019s ArrayExpress. Cancer types: Classification is based on NCIt. 3. Describe NCIt, ICD-O, UBERON codes, and their relationships. NCIt (National Cancer Institute Thesaurus) is a dynamically developed hierarchical ontology that supports layered data aggregation and translation between classification systems and resources. It covers areas such as cancer diagnosis, histology, biology, treatment, and genetic abnormalities. In Progenetix, NCIt is used as a standard ontology. All samples are assigned NCIt codes and integrated into 51 main nodes to enable comparison of CNV patterns, among other applications. ICD-O (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology) provides organ- and substructure-specific mapping rooted in traditional clinical and diagnostic aspects of a \"tumor entity\", describing cancer by combining morphology and topography codes. UBERON (Uber Anatomy Ontology) is a cross-species anatomical ontology system closely aligned with developmental processes. In Progenetix, existing ICD-O based data is mapped to both NCIt and UBERON. 4. What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies and how to use them? CNV segmentation is a record of copy number changes (amplifications or deletions) for each contiguous region (segment) of the genome. In Progenetix, the most prevalent copy number is set as the baseline, and the relative copy number gains and losses per sample are derived based on the assumption that relative gene dosage imbalance has pathophysiological effects in cancer biology. CNV frequencies refer to the percentage of genomic regions with copy number aberrations across multiple samples. Typically, genomes are binned, and the amplification and deletion rates for each region are calculated. Segmentation is used for structural analysis of individual genomes, while frequency is used to compare and identify trends at the group level, such as differences between cancer types or subtypes, the identification of \"hot spot\" regions, and the assessment of the functional significance of aberrant regions. 5. What are APIs and how to use APIs in Progenetix? An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows programs to interact with software and databases. In Progenetix, the query interface for retrieving sample-specific data is built on a forward-looking implementation of the GA4GH Beacon API. This allows users to access, search, and retrieve cancer genome data directly from their own programs. 6. How does Progenetix visualise CNA profiles? Progenetix provides visual summaries showing the number of matched samples, variants, calls, and the frequency of alleles with CNAs. CNA frequencies in each chromosome region are shown using bar plots, and CNV fractions across the genome for each sample are visualized with dot plots. Information about biosamples is also included. Additionally, users can upload their own segmentation files for visualization. 7. What do you think should be improved in Progenetix? Since there are 98 unmapped terms in the NCIt ontology tree structure, there are limitations in treating Progenetix as a fully classifiable dataset. Mapping accuracy, automation, and the frequency of updates should be improved. Geographic coordinates are often inferred from author addresses or contact information, which may differ from the actual origin of the patient or sample. Therefore, the accuracy of patient origin data should be improved. For some samples, ancestry groups are estimated from SNP data, but overall coverage is limited. Thus, the sample base for ASCN analysis should be expanded to allow for analysis across a wider range of racial and ethnic groups.","title":"BIO392 Assignment Day 3"},{"location":"Megumi-Mizoguchi/Mizoguchi_Megumi_paper_reading_day3/#bio392-assignment-day-3","text":"Reference Huang Q, Carrio-Cordo P, Gao B, Paloots R, Baudis M.

A draft human pangenome reference. Nature. 2023 May;617(7960):312\u2013324. doi: 10.1038/s41586-023-05896-x. Why is the Pangenome project interesting? The pangenome project is interesting because it aims to overcome the limitations of the current human reference genome (GRCh38), which represents a single linear mosaic haplotype. GRCh38 lacks large portions of polymorphic sequence found in the human population, particularly within structural variants (SVs), leading to an observational bias. By constructing a pangenome using 47 phased, diploid assemblies from genetically diverse individuals, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) provides a reference that captures known variants and haplotypes and reveals new alleles at structurally complex loci. This enables more accurate genomic analysis: for example, small variant discovery errors were reduced by 34% and structural variant detection increased by 104% compared with GRCh38-based workflows. What makes the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) approach different from previous reference genome constructions? The T2T approach differs from previous reference genome constructions in that it produced the first complete sequence of a haploid human genome (T2T-CHM13), offering a contiguous representation of each autosome and chromosome X. Unlike GRCh38, which contains 210 Mb of gap or computationally simulated sequences (6.7% of the primary scaffolds), T2T-CHM13 covers regions previously inaccessible, such as centromeres and satellite arrays. For example, it enables the discovery of 3.7 million additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and improves the representation of copy number variants (CNVs) in the 1000 Genomes Project. Why is the T2T genome not a classical reference genome? The T2T-CHM13 remains a single genome and cannot represent the full spectrum of human genetic diversity. The reference consists of only one haplotype and lacks alternative alleles for structural variants that are polymorphic within the population. As a result, two-thirds of SVs have been missed in studies using short-read data aligned to the T2T genome or GRCh38. Thus, T2T-CHM13, while complete, does not function as a comprehensive population reference and still introduces reference bias in genomic analyses. How does the pangenome address the limitations of the T2T genome to build a true reference genome? The pangenome addresses the limitations of T2T-CHM13 by incorporating 47 phased, diploid genome assemblies from a diverse cohort, capturing both common and rare variants across different ancestry groups. Unlike T2T-CHM13, the pangenome enables the representation of structural variation at single-base resolution and includes 119 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,115 gene duplications relative to GRCh38. Roughly 90 million of these additional base pairs are derived from structural variation. By aligning all assemblies to build a unified graph representation, the pangenome removes the constraints of a single haploid reference and serves as a true population reference that better represents global genomic diversity. It also includes T2T-CHM13 as one of the assemblies. What is being sequenced and why work? The pangenome project sequenced 47 fully phased, diploid genome assemblies representing genetically diverse individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project and other cohorts. Each sample was deeply sequenced using multiple technologies including PacBio HiFi, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Bionano optical mapping, and Hi-C, with Illumina sequencing used for parental data. The high sequence coverage (average 39.7\u00d7 HiFi depth) ensures comprehensive variant discovery irrespective of allele frequency. The assemblies were constructed using the Trio-Hifiasm assembler, which leverages both long reads and parental short reads for near-complete phasing. The rationale for this work is to construct a population-wide reference that captures the full spectrum of human genetic variation, improves variant calling, and enables unbiased genome analysis. What additional contribution can it offer for genomics? The pangenome contributes significantly to genomics by enabling comprehensive analysis of structural variation, gene duplications, and variant phasing. It allows accurate transcriptome annotation. Moreover, it permits the resolution of complex structural haplotypes\u2014such as those at RHD\u2013RHCE, HLA-A, CYP2D6\u2013CYP2D7, C4, and LPA\u2014at single-base resolution, something that was previously unachievable with short-read data. The pangenome also serves as a benchmark for the development of new tools and resources for genome analysis, including graph-based variant calling and pangenome alignment software. What future benefit for genome data analysis can the T2T/pangenome approach attribute? They enable reference-free or reference-aware variant calling with higher precision and recall. This leads to more accurate detection of both small and structural variants, especially in medically relevant and repetitive genomic regions. As the HPRC expands to 700 haplotypes, it is projected to add at least 150 Mb of euchromatic sequence, further enhancing the comprehensiveness of the pangenome. Together, these advances will improve diagnostic yield, uncover previously undetectable variants, and support precision medicine by providing a better understanding of individual genetic backgrounds.","title":"Homework: 2025.04.08"},{"location":"Megumi-Mizoguchi/Pangenome_reference_202504_Megumi-Mizoguchi/#homework-20250408","text":"","title":"Homework: 2025.04.08"},{"location":"Megumi-Mizoguchi/Pangenome_reference_202504_Megumi-Mizoguchi/#reference","text":"Liao WW, Asri M, Ebler J, Doerr D, Haukness M, Hickey G, Lu S, Lucas JK, Monlong J, Abel HJ, Buonaiuto S, Chang XH, Cheng H, Chu J, Colonna V, Eizenga JM, Feng X, Fischer C, Fulton RS, Garg S, Groza C, Guarracino A, Harvey WT, Heumos S, Howe K, Jain M, Lu TY, Markello C, Martin FJ, Mitchell MW, Munson KM, Mwaniki MN, Novak AM, Olsen HE, Pesout T, Porubsky D, Prins P, Sibbesen JA, Sir\u00e9n J, Tomlinson C, Villani F, Vollger MR, Antonacci-Fulton LL, Baid G, Baker CA, Belyaeva A, Billis K, Carroll A, Chang PC, Cody S, Cook DE, Cook-Deegan RM, Cornejo OE, Diekhans M, Ebert P, Fairley S, Fedrigo O, Felsenfeld AL, Formenti G, Frankish A, Gao Y, Garrison NA, Giron CG, Green RE, Haggerty L, Hoekzema K, Hourlier T, Ji HP, Kenny EE, Koenig BA, Kolesnikov A, Korbel JO, Kordosky J, Koren S, Lee H, Lewis AP, Magalh\u00e3es H, Marco-Sola S, Marijon P, McCartney A, McDaniel J, Mountcastle J, Nattestad M, Nurk S, Olson ND, Popejoy AB, Puiu D, Rautiainen M, Regier AA, Rhie A, Sacco S, Sanders AD, Schneider VA, Schultz BI, Shafin K, Smith MW, Sofia HJ, Abou Tayoun AN, Thibaud-Nissen F, Tricomi FF, Wagner J, Walenz B, Wood JMD, Zimin AV, Bourque G, Chaisson MJP, Flicek P, Phillippy AM, Zook JM, Eichler EE, Haussler D, Wang T, Jarvis ED, Miga KH, Garrison E, Marschall T, Hall IM, Li H, Paten B.

This report explains how much storage is needed for sequencing data from 1000 human genomes and the role of different file formats used in genomics. I focus on five common formats: SAM, BAM, CRAM, VCF, and FASTA. These differ in size and purpose. For example, some are better for long-term storage, others are used to store only the differences between individuals. File Formats and Their Uses SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) Purpose : Text-based format for storing aligned sequencing reads. Usage : Mainly used during analysis or debugging. It\u2019s not practical for storage because the files are very large. Size per genome : ~150 GB BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) Purpose : A compressed, binary version of SAM that\u2019s easier to store and access. Usage : Commonly used for archiving sequencing data because it\u2019s smaller and can be indexed for quick searching. Size per genome : ~100 GB (for 30\u00d7 whole-genome sequencing) CRAM (Compressed Reference-Aligned Map) Purpose : Like BAM, but even more compressed using a reference genome to save space. Usage : Useful when saving storage space is important, especially for long-term storage. A reference genome is needed to open the files. Size per genome : ~30\u201350 GB VCF (Variant Call Format) Purpose : Stores only the genetic differences (variants) compared to a reference genome. Usage : Used to summarize results after sequencing, especially for analysis and visualization. Much smaller than BAM or CRAM files. Size per genome : ~0.5\u20132 GB FASTA Purpose : Text format for the actual DNA (or protein) sequence. Usage : Stores the reference genome. This is the \"standard\" genome that other samples are compared to. The same reference file is shared across all individuals in a study.

Why It's Interesting Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) Since its initial release in 2000, the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) has not achieved a complete model of the human genome. Its assembly, based on sequenced bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), is incomplete for repetitive sequences. The GRCh38 reference assembly contains approximately 151 Mbp of missing sequences over the genome, especially in pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions, heterochromatin, segmental duplications, ampliconic gene arrays, and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays. All of which are highly relevant for fundamental cellular processes. Contribution The newly introduced T2T-CHM13 reference assembly completes the final 8% of the human genome, including all centromeric regions and the entire short arms of the five acrocentric chromosomes. It was created using the complementary strengths of PacBio's HiFi and Oxford's Nanopore ultra-long reads. The T2T-CHM13 assembly is the first complete human genome sequence without any gaps resulting in a telomere-to-telomere across all 22 autosomes and chromosome X. It contains 3,054,815,472 bp of nuclear DNA and a 16,569 bp mitochondrial genome. In comparison to GRCh38, it discovered 238 Mbp of additional sequence, 182 Mbp of which does not align with GRCh38 over \u22651 Mbp intervals. The assembly resolves the full structure of all centromeric satellite arrays, recent segmental duplications, 219 full-length rDNA units, and the entire short arms of acrocentric chromosomes, which were previously represented as >150 Mbp of placeholder or synthetic sequence in GRCh38. In addition, it includes 1,956 new gene predictions (99 assumed to be protein coding). Compared to the 8% of unresolved genome regions of GRCh38, T2T-CHM13 only consists of 0.3% potentially missing due to errors. 2. What Makes the T2T Approach Different PacBio and Oxford Nanopore PacBio\u2019s long, multi-kilobase single reads were helpful at resolving large gaps in the GRCh38 assembly. Oxford Nanopore's ultra-long reads, exceeding 100 kbp, enabled the first complete assembly of a human centromere (ChrY) and an entire chromosome (ChrX). However, the relatively high error rates (>5%) of both technologies made it difficult to assemble long repeat arrays. PacBio\u2019s latest circular consensus sequencing, known as \"HiFi\", was introduced as a game changer providing reads up to 20 kbp in length with an error rate of 0.1%. CHM13hTERT GRCh38 was created from multiple individuals which resulted in a mosaic of haplotypes rather than a single consistent diploid genome. In contrast, T2T assemble the CHM13hTERT cell line which was later analyzed to be, with the exception of a few thousand variants and a megabase-scale deletion, nearly homozygous. Most CHM genomes originate from the loss of the maternal DNA and duplication of the paternal parts and are homozygous with a 46,XX karyotype. Graph Walk The HiFi reads were converted into a bidirected string graph, where nodes are assembled sequences with a very low error rate and edges are overlaps between them. The nodes themselves were compressed and corrected for simple sequence repeats. In contrast to previous assembly algorithms, the graph walk for T2T was based only on exact overlaps instead of involving stochastic or heuristic models. Assembly of rRNA, which occur in multiples of 45 kbp repeats within short arms of acrocentric chromosomes, was achieved using Bruijn graph algorithm before being corrected by HiFi reads. 3. Future Benefits of T2T for Genome Analysis The T2T-CHM13 assembly is a significantly more complete, representative, and accurate reference than GRCh38. Especially for variation that lies within the most repetitive regions of the genome. Disease research focusing on Copy Number Variations (CNVs) gains new insights from the resolved 151 Mbp artificial regions of GRC38. Furthermore, aligning long-read sequences will be easier with the new quality gold standard. This provides the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) with a new toolset to create a diverse collection of reference genomes, overcoming the limitations of a single model. Its achievements also are a pathway for precisely sequencing the ChrY using HiFi technique and automate the assembly of diploid genomes.

CNV stands for Copy Number Variations , frequently observed structural genome variations in the form of repeats and deletions CNA stands for Copy Number Aberration , more severe versions of CNVs which are present in the majority of cancer types CNAs affect large genomic regions and have an impact on cancer development 2) How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)? Progenetix is a publicly accessible cancer genome data resource that provides comprehensive insights into genomic variation profiles in cancer The database combines various data sources such as GEO, ArrayExpress, TCGA, cBioPortal and hundreds of processed publications It holds a rich combination of metadata about the geographical origin and mappings such as the cancer types mapped to NCIt and ICD-O The web platform simplifies data visualization and data querying Progenetix hosts over 138k CNV profiles from 127k individuals, including 115k tumor samples and 10 million genomic variants The dataset covering a wide spectrum of cancer loci including breast, brain, skin, colon, and lymph 3) Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships. NCIt, ICOD and UBERON are schemas which allow classification and describe cancer types and diseases. NCIt (National Cancer Institute Thesaurus) is a dynamically developed hierarchical ontology used for cancer type classification which enables layered data aggregation and transfers between resources. Progenetix maps its preserved samples to the NCIt ontology for improved integration and querying. ICD-O (International Classification of Diseases in Oncology) is a classification system for diseases. ICD-O Morphology and Topography coding systems allow for high specificity while being limited in its hierarchical structure. UBERON is a cross-species anatomical structural ontology. Progenetix maps all ICD-O T codes to UBERON terms. 4) What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them? CNV segmentation is used to label genomic regions with different copy numbers. Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) is a statistically based segmentation algorithm which labels regions based on the change in local log2 values compared to the overall mean. CNV segmentation can be used to associate certain CNVs with cancer types. CNV frequency is the ratio of samples with a CNA in a specific region. They are used to compare population or datasets to gain information about genetic diversity and population characteristics 5) What are APIs and how to use APIs in Progenetix? Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow querying services in a standardized format and process Progenetix offers state-of-the-art endpoint standards such as Beacon API (GA4GH v2) and Phenopackets-based APIs The API endpoints of Progenetix can be used to query data which is pre-processed, filtered and transformed according to the request to allow seamless integration into any client service or research The Progenetix APIs reduce the workload for researchers by providing powerful filters such as cancer type, tissue location, cell line, geographical location or morphology 6) How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles? Progenetix visualizes the CNA profiles in an interactive Results tab. Various links allow to further visualize the results such as by a geographical map A histogram shows the percentage of samples affected across all chromosomes. Yellow bars represent copy number gains, while blue bars indicate losses The matched subset samples are listed by NCIt/ICD-O codes, the number of subset samples, the number of matched samples, and the relative frequencies of matches in the subset The progenetix data can further be downloaded in CSV or JSON format 7) What do you think should be improved in Progenetix? Improve the time it takes to display results Improve the intuitive user interface for people with a quantitative but less biology-focused background Add a Captcha for queries to protect the database from being used maliciously Create a similarity metric to cluster similar CNAs by population or chromosome","title":"Day III \u2013 Progenetix"},{"location":"Sandrin-Hunkeler/hunkeler_sandrin_paper_reading_day3/#day-iii-progenetix","text":"","title":"Day III \u2013 Progenetix"},{"location":"Sandrin-Hunkeler/hunkeler_sandrin_paper_reading_day3/#sandrin-hunkeler-msc-in-informatics","text":"","title":"Sandrin Hunkeler (MSc. in Informatics)"},{"location":"Sandrin-Hunkeler/hunkeler_sandrin_paper_reading_day3/#1-what-is-cnvcna","text":"CNV stands for Copy Number Variations , frequently observed structural genome variations in the form of repeats and deletions CNA stands for Copy Number Aberration , more severe versions of CNVs which are present in the majority of cancer types CNAs affect large genomic regions and have an impact on cancer development","title":"1) What is CNV/CNA?"},{"location":"Sandrin-Hunkeler/hunkeler_sandrin_paper_reading_day3/#2-how-will-you-describe-or-introduce-progenetix-scale-data-source-cancer-types-and-so-on","text":"Progenetix is a publicly accessible cancer genome data resource that provides comprehensive insights into genomic variation profiles in cancer The database combines various data sources such as GEO, ArrayExpress, TCGA, cBioPortal and hundreds of processed publications It holds a rich combination of metadata about the geographical origin and mappings such as the cancer types mapped to NCIt and ICD-O The web platform simplifies data visualization and data querying Progenetix hosts over 138k CNV profiles from 127k individuals, including 115k tumor samples and 10 million genomic variants The dataset covering a wide spectrum of cancer loci including breast, brain, skin, colon, and lymph","title":"2) How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)?"},{"location":"Sandrin-Hunkeler/hunkeler_sandrin_paper_reading_day3/#3-describe-ncit-icod-uberon-codes-and-their-relationships","text":"NCIt, ICOD and UBERON are schemas which allow classification and describe cancer types and diseases.

Are there any adapter sequences in the data? Why do you think this is? Answer My plot differes a lot from the reference on the slides. My data was created artificially and has an uniform quality. This results in a very thin and barely visible bloxplot. This indicates no variation in quality across positions. I assume no adapter sequences in the generated dataset. This, since adapters are used for aligning sequences and are introduced for practical reasons. The sequences of the adapters are known in advance and therefore removed for improved quality. Q2 Given the FastQC reports, does it make sense to perform adapter and/or quality trimming on your data? Answer Based on my plots, the trimming is not necessary. No adapter contaminations are visible, which would be present in a real-world dataset. Furthermore, the uniform quality does not indicate to be in the red or yellow area. If a real-world dataset would indicate low quality in the red or yellow area, I would perform trimming to improve the quality for downstream processes. This is especially important for adapters since they are not part of the real genome but added for practical purposes. Q3 Why are so many files in the bioinformatics pipeline compressed and indexed? Answer Files in this workflow are very large. Indexes are additional data structures which improve access speed and file sizes. Compression further helps to remove redundant information and reduce the file sizes drastically. This improves long time storage costs, transmission speed but also the performance of downstream applications. This allows to access the files without fully loading into memory and increases random access of any genome position. Compressions using binary formats have the disadvantage of decreased human readability. Q4 In the bash script that processes alignment files, you will see calls to samtools sort , samtools view , and samtools index . Explain what these three programs do. Why do you think each program is needed? Answer samtools sort https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-sort.html The sort command sorts the alignments by the leftmost coordinates. This makes downstream searches and processes much faster, especially accesses for genomic regions. samtools view https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-view.html This binary views and converts SAM/BAM/CRAM files. Here is it used to convert SAM files, which are plain text, into the binary BAM format. This reduces the file size and simplifies the transformation. samtools index https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-index.html Index tools can be used to create indexes for various file types such as SAM, BAM or CRAM. The indexes work on coordinate sorted files and creates lookups for fast access of regions and the genome data in general. Why are all three needed? Each command contributes to making the alignment data usable and efficient: samtools sort : sorts the alignments by coordinates. samtools view : converts text-based files to a compressed format making access and transformation faster. samtools index : creates index to access regions and specific parts very performant. Q5 Explain what files are needed for GangSTR to run. Specifically: explain what information is provided to GangSTR via the --ref , --region , and --bam command line arguments. Answer GangSTR allows to perform genome profiling for tandem repeats from short reads. It has the advantage of allowing repeats larger than the initial read length. For the binaries to work correctly, it needs the following resources: --ref : Passes the path of the reference genome in FASTA format. GangSTR uses this to align repeat regions. --regions : References a file specifying the regions of the genome. This is used to reference sequences in the genome. --bam : Supplies the aligned reads in BAM format. GangSTR uses those reads to detect and type the repeat lengths for each STR region. GangSTR then produces various output files: - $patient_1.vcf.gz : Genotyped STR profil of sample in compressed VCF format. - $patient_1.samplestats.tab : Statistical information about the process and the results. - $patient_1.vcf.gz : Detailed STR profil of patient. Together, these inputs enable GangSTR to locate, analyze, and quantify STRs of the patients. Q6 Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? Answer STRs mutate much more than any other type of variation and are therefore majorly contributing to genetic variation. Expanding STRs can cause various disorders, such as Fragile X syndrom and muscular atrophy. The repeats can disrupt RNA splicing or gene expression. It affects fundamental processes of the genome and are likely to be present genome-wide. Understanding STRs and their implications would be highly beneficial for developing treatments and preventive therapies for affected people. Q7 What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? Answer STRs are complex variations of the genome and challenging to link to diseases. Traditional pedigree analysis often fails to follow the multi-allelic patterns of STRs. Furthermore, medical sequencing studies often leave out STRs due to technical capabilities of sequencing pipelines, which reach their limits with highly repetitive sequences. Filtering techniques often reduce them explicitly from studies. Anomalies in reconstruction of genomes and poor sequence alignment can easily degrade STR results. Q8 What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools? Answer According to the GangSTR GitHub repository , GangSTR stands out from other STR genotyping tools due to the following key differences: Support for Long Repeats GangSTR can genotype STR regions that are longer than the sequencing read length of the applies sequencing technique. This especially allows to analyze highly expanded sequences which would otherwise not be detected. Genome-Wide STR Profiling GangSTR is capable of analyzing the whole genome at once while other tools are limited in their scope. Standardized Inputs and Outputs: GangSTR makes heavily use of existing standards. It accepts BAM files and STR catalogues as input, while outputing VCF files. It was built with existing file types in mind and integrates well into existing pipelines and workflows. Q9 What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping? Answer GanSTR uses mainly four types of indicators to estimate the the number of repeats. Enclosing Reads: STRs which are flanked by different regions cover the whole STR. They are the simplest form of STRs and allow to directly count the number of STRs. Spanning Reads: Spanning reads estimate the number of repeats by estimating the shift in periodical reads. If each read is roughly the same size, a shift in the read compared to the reference genome indicates a shifted read due to STRs. GangSTR estimates the number of repeats by the size of the shift. Flanking Reads: Flanking reads are the start or the end of an STR. The number of repeats could be much longer. Therefore, multiple flanking reads are used to estimate the real length. Fully Repetitive Reads: Those are reads which only span the repetitive sequences. The total number of read sequences is used to estimate the real length of the STR. If there are many independent reads of the same sequence, the total size of the STR is assumed to be large as well.","title":"Day VII \u2013 STR"},{"location":"Sandrin-Hunkeler/hunkeler_sandrin_question_day_07/#day-vii-str","text":"","title":"Day VII \u2013 STR"},{"location":"Sandrin-Hunkeler/hunkeler_sandrin_question_day_07/#sandrin-hunkeler-msc-in-informatics","text":"","title":"Sandrin Hunkeler (MSc. in Informatics)"},{"location":"Sandrin-Hunkeler/hunkeler_sandrin_question_day_07/#q1","text":"Does the sequence quality graph of your data look different from the examples shown in the slides?

Please change the name of this file to \\<First letter>-\\<Last name>-questions-day-07.md, and upload it to your folder in the course GitHub. These questions will be graded. The most important thing is not that you get everything right, but that you show that you thought about the questions; so no copy/pasting! Practical Q1 Does the sequence quality graph of your data look different from the examples shown in the slides? Are there any adapter sequences in the data? Why do you think this is? The sequence quality graph looks different from the one in the slides (there are no boxes). This is due to that the data is simulated, due to this the box-plots are all the same, and there are no differences between and within the reads. They all have the same quality score. There are no adapter sequences that are normally used for the sequencing process because this is no real data, but simulated data. Q2 Given the FastQC reports, does it make sense to perform adapter and/or quality-trimming on your data? No, because they already have the same quality score and there are no adaptor sequences. All 6 plots look the same. Q3 Why are so many files in the bioinformatics pipeline compressed and indexed? This is the case because the normal files (as eg. FASTQ, BAM, VCF) are often huge. By compressing them they are reduced in size and it is easier to work with them, they need less storage space and can speed up processes. Indexing is helpful when not the hole file, but a specific part is needed. The index tells where to specifically jump in the file without having to read the hole file (kind of like a bookmark). This leads to much faster processes and targeted acces. Q4 In the bash script that processes alignment files, you will see calls to samtools sort, samtools view, and samtools index (among others). Explain what these three programs do. Why do you think each program is needed? Hint: look at the Samtools manual . samtools sort: This is used to sort alignments according to the leftmost coordinates. Depending on the option added it is sorted in another way (eg. -n: sorted by read name, -t: sorted by tag name, ...) samtools view: This is to view and convert files. The option determins in what format it is printed. With no option the file is printed in the specified input alignment file. samtools index: This indexes the files to a fast random acces. The file needs to be BGZF compressed. The options determine the type of index. The programs are needed for a faster and specific processing of the data. With it one can easily determin how the files should be sorted, view and indexed. Some programs as for example GangSTR require a specific file format that are sorted and indexed. For this samtools can be used. Q5 Explain what files are needed for GangSTR to run. Specifically: explain what information is provided to GangSTR via the --ref, --region, and --bam command line arguments. Hint: look at the GangSTR manual . The files in the folder needed for GangSTR to run (automatically created): 1. insdata.tab: For the insertion data, in a tab-delimited text format. 2. tats.tab: A tab-delimited file (only plain text which makes it easy to read and parse) 3. vcf.gz: A Variant Call Format in a gzip-compressed Form Comand line arguments/options that are required for GangSTR: 1. --ref:That the input is a reference genome in FASTA format. The same reference must be used to build the alignment of the sequences in the BAM file. This it to compare the region to. 2. --region: A reference set of regions to genotype that is in a BED-like file with specific columns (chromosome name, start and end positions of the STR, repeat motif and length) 3. --bam: That it is a sorted and indexed BAM file produced by an indel-sensitive aligner (as required). 4. another option that is required is the --out, a prefix to name the output file Literature During the practical so far, you have generated variant calls from short read sequencing data using bioinformatics approaches. Now it's time to take a step back and do some background reading in order to prepare for the analysis and interpretation of the results next week. First, read the following sections of this review : * Abstract * Introduction`` * Genotyping STRs from high-throughput sequencing data Then, answer Q4 and Q5. Q6 Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? STRs play a role in regulating gene expression and molecular phenotyps this can contribute to diseases and health due to a change in the repeats they contribute to cancer, complex trains and Mendelian diseases by inducing pathogenic effects. These effects can be polyglutamine aggregation, hypermethylations, RNA toxicity and repeat associated non-ATG tranlations. They can also effect RNA splicing. All these can lead to an increased risk for specific diseases. Q7 What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? Challenges include: * the reads are often to short, not capturing the hole repeats. This leads to loss of informative reads and with that to less quality . * the low quality calls lead to filtering of the STRs from sequencing pipelines (even of known pathogenic STRs) * long insertions / deletions lead to problems when aligning with the reference genome -> mapping bias * PCR amplification can introduce \"stutter\" noise in the number of repeats Either information is lost, the quality is low or there are biases that occure during the processing, all these lead to an unaquarte and information lacking data. Due to new bioinformatic tools and sequencing techniques there are now improvements for these challenges. Second, read the following sections of the paper describing GangSTR : * Abstract * Introduction * Overview of the GangSTR model Then, answer Q6 and Q7. Q8 What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools? GangSTR is more accurate and faster than other solutions It can be used genome wide and not only on a small pannel It is able to identify novel pathogenic expansions and can be used for GWAS of TR varianton in large cohorts Q9 What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping? It extracts information from paired-end reads (enclosing, spanning and flanking read pairs) from NGS data (the gold standard) into a single model and then estimates the diploid repeat lengths.","title":"BIO392-day-07 Questions"},{"location":"Sara-Burckhardt/S-burckhardt-questions_day_07/#bio392-day-07-questions","text":"These questions are designed to test your understanding of the sequence analysis practical and the accompanying literature.

Are there any adapter sequences in the data? Why do you think this is? The sequence quality graph looks different from the one in the slides (there are no boxes). This is due to that the data is simulated, due to this the box-plots are all the same, and there are no differences between and within the reads. They all have the same quality score. There are no adapter sequences that are normally used for the sequencing process because this is no real data, but simulated data.","title":"Q1"},{"location":"Sara-Burckhardt/S-burckhardt-questions_day_07/#q2","text":"Given the FastQC reports, does it make sense to perform adapter and/or quality-trimming on your data? No, because they already have the same quality score and there are no adaptor sequences. All 6 plots look the same.","title":"Q2"},{"location":"Sara-Burckhardt/S-burckhardt-questions_day_07/#q3","text":"Why are so many files in the bioinformatics pipeline compressed and indexed? This is the case because the normal files (as eg. FASTQ, BAM, VCF) are often huge. By compressing them they are reduced in size and it is easier to work with them, they need less storage space and can speed up processes. Indexing is helpful when not the hole file, but a specific part is needed. The index tells where to specifically jump in the file without having to read the hole file (kind of like a bookmark). This leads to much faster processes and targeted acces.","title":"Q3"},{"location":"Sara-Burckhardt/S-burckhardt-questions_day_07/#q4","text":"In the bash script that processes alignment files, you will see calls to samtools sort, samtools view, and samtools index (among others). Explain what these three programs do. Why do you think each program is needed? Hint: look at the Samtools manual . samtools sort: This is used to sort alignments according to the leftmost coordinates. Depending on the option added it is sorted in another way (eg. -n: sorted by read name, -t: sorted by tag name, ...) samtools view: This is to view and convert files. The option determins in what format it is printed. With no option the file is printed in the specified input alignment file. samtools index: This indexes the files to a fast random acces. The file needs to be BGZF compressed. The options determine the type of index. The programs are needed for a faster and specific processing of the data. With it one can easily determin how the files should be sorted, view and indexed. Some programs as for example GangSTR require a specific file format that are sorted and indexed. For this samtools can be used.","title":"Q4"},{"location":"Sara-Burckhardt/S-burckhardt-questions_day_07/#q5","text":"Explain what files are needed for GangSTR to run. Specifically: explain what information is provided to GangSTR via the --ref, --region, and --bam command line arguments. Hint: look at the GangSTR manual . The files in the folder needed for GangSTR to run (automatically created): 1. insdata.tab: For the insertion data, in a tab-delimited text format. 2. tats.tab: A tab-delimited file (only plain text which makes it easy to read and parse) 3. vcf.gz: A Variant Call Format in a gzip-compressed Form Comand line arguments/options that are required for GangSTR: 1. --ref:That the input is a reference genome in FASTA format. The same reference must be used to build the alignment of the sequences in the BAM file. This it to compare the region to. 2. --region: A reference set of regions to genotype that is in a BED-like file with specific columns (chromosome name, start and end positions of the STR, repeat motif and length) 3. --bam: That it is a sorted and indexed BAM file produced by an indel-sensitive aligner (as required). 4. another option that is required is the --out, a prefix to name the output file","title":"Q5"},{"location":"Sara-Burckhardt/S-burckhardt-questions_day_07/#literature","text":"During the practical so far, you have generated variant calls from short read sequencing data using bioinformatics approaches.

STRs play a role in regulating gene expression and molecular phenotyps this can contribute to diseases and health due to a change in the repeats they contribute to cancer, complex trains and Mendelian diseases by inducing pathogenic effects. These effects can be polyglutamine aggregation, hypermethylations, RNA toxicity and repeat associated non-ATG tranlations. They can also effect RNA splicing. All these can lead to an increased risk for specific diseases.","title":"Q6"},{"location":"Sara-Burckhardt/S-burckhardt-questions_day_07/#q7","text":"What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? Challenges include: * the reads are often to short, not capturing the hole repeats. This leads to loss of informative reads and with that to less quality . * the low quality calls lead to filtering of the STRs from sequencing pipelines (even of known pathogenic STRs) * long insertions / deletions lead to problems when aligning with the reference genome -> mapping bias * PCR amplification can introduce \"stutter\" noise in the number of repeats Either information is lost, the quality is low or there are biases that occure during the processing, all these lead to an unaquarte and information lacking data.

The Human Pangenome Reference consists of 47 phased, diploid assemblies of the genome (more than 99% of the expected sequence and 99% accurate) of genetically diverse individuals. These individuals represent the global genetic diversity. These assemblies were then aligned, and a draft was generated that captures the known variants and haplotypes. For each participant also whole genome sequencing data from both parents is available which is useful for haplotype phasing. Additionally, to the genomes millions of base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and gene duplicates related to the existing reference GRCh38 were added. This creates a more diverse and accurate representation of the genome as one can observe directly where variability occurs compared to the classical single genome reference as for example the GRCh38. They constructed three graph construction methods which all are built up differently. They did not only chose a single one, because in this way they got a good comparison which methods work best and what their advantages are and also in general to see if their results could be reliable. The focus of the pangenome was to build a reference resource with multiple genomes, but the high accuracy of the haplotype-resolved assemblies also enabled access to previously inaccessible regions, new forms of genetic variation and further insight in mutational processes. They did a lot of comparing and analysis on how accurate and improved their methods are compared to the older references. There they saw that the pangenome showed huge improvements in multiple ways. They could prove a highly contiguous and accuracy of the sequences and the performance in gene variation, alignment, complex multiallelic SVs, etc. was better than compared to the single reference. 2) What makes the T2T approach different from previous reference genome construction For a long time, the human reference genome GRCh38 was used. This reference genome includes only about 92-95% of the haploid genome. Recently, the first Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) genome (T2T-CHM13) was finished. With this new genome, which contains 100% of then genome, genomic analysis can be improved, as it for example better represents the true copy number variant (CNVs). Although the T2T is very good, it is not able to represent variations / genetic diversity. So, the idea occurred to bring multiple genomes together and create a pangenome for reference. In this pangenome the GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13 were also included. As this pangenome is finished, further developments are to also make the pangenome to a T2T to not only get the diversity but also the full genome. 3) General estimate what the future benefit for genome data analysis is and what can directly be tributed to the T2T / pangenome --> what is the Contribution? The pangenome aims to improve downstream analysis workflows through removing mapping biases that can occur when using a single linear reference genome. It also improves the accuracy of calling small variants when doing short reads as the pangenome has a gain in both SNPs and indels compared to other approaches, due to using long reads. In challenging medically relevant genes, the increase is even larger for both. These improvements where driven both by better sequencing technology (reducing errors, longer reads, \u2026) and assembly algorithms. A goal now is to increase the pangenome even further and introduce more individuals to capture most common variants and to push it towards T2T genomes for this cohort to represent the entire genome. With the more diverse human reference map also the eventual applications of genomic research and precision medicine are effective for all populations. Also, in general genome data analysis will get more accurate as now more and more is known and variances are introduced and one can compare with a diverse and not an single reference. Genome data analysis will get accessible to a broader range as it contains the diversity but due to the huge data amount it will also get more complicated which needs a good intarface to use the pangenome.

The Progenetix oncogenomic resource in 2021. Database (2021) Vol. 2021: article ID baab043; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baab043 What is CNV/CNA? Copy number variation (CNV) and copy number aberrations (CNA) are structural genome variations due to deletions, duplications or insertions. In cancer they are ubiquitous and frequently extensive and can have a functional impact on the cancer development. How will you describe or introduce progenetix? A freely accessible data resource where the idea is to bring all the available data together and process them such as that one can easily compare them (identify & characterize molecular subtypes, meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections, \u2026). Progenetix focuses on individual cancer CNA profiles and associates phenotypic information and additional metadata dedicated to cancer studies in all different cancer biologies. They also provide services related to data annotation, meta-analysis and visualization. The data is from individual studies and datasets that report genome profiling experiments based on molecular cytogenetics and sequencing. Progenetix includes over 138\u2019000 CNV profiles with 788 distinct NCIt terms (2021). Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships. NCIt is the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus which categorizes distinct cancer types in a dynamically developed hierarchical ontology. The International Classification of Diseases in Oncology (ICD-O) classifies cancer sample in an organ- and tissue-specific mapping based on traditional clinical and diagnostic aspects. It is limited in hierarchical representation. UBERON is a cross-species anatomical structural ontology system closely aligned with developmental processes. Here one can make logic query within and between organisms (eg. model animals and humans). All three are classification systems and have their advantages and disadvantages. Progenetix mapped them together so that the samples contain the three codes, making it able to look at them in the different classifications. What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them? CNV segmentations are regions of the genome with consistent CNVs in an individual. They can be used for structural analysis of individuals. CNV frequencies are percentages of genomic regions with CNVs across samples they are used to compare and identify trends between multiple individuals, populations, etc. What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix? APIs are application programming interfaces that provide support for a number of data services that make use of special resources in Progenetix or alternative forms of data delivery. In Progenetix the Beacon API is used. Beacon is a protocol and specification that facilitates the discovery of genomic variants and biomedical data from different organisational and geographic locations. How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles? Progenetix visualises CNA profiles in CNV Histograms where on the x-axis the different chromosomes are displayed and on the y-axis the percentage of loss and gain. The distribution per region is then visualized in blue for loss and in yellow for gain. What do you think should be improved in progenetix?

For example, in the GRCh38 reference assembly, created using BAC, large amounts of unknown sequence remain unaccounted for.

A CNA (opy number abberation) is more often disease-associated and has a pathogenic connotation. Progenetix Information One can obtain curated individual cancer CNA profiles and the associated Metadata. Initially, the datasources are published studies and data repositories, but the focus lies on data from chromosomal Comparitive Genomic Hybridzation (CGH, 2001). Then data was added from publications about genome variation profiles in cancer that use molecular cytogenetics (CGH, genomic arrays) and sequencing techniques (WGS-whole genome, WES-whole exom) Now in 2021 new sources have been added like the arrayMap data collection, the Cancer Genome Atlas, cBioPortal, NCBI\u00b4s GEO and EMBL-EBI\u00b4s ArrayExpress. The goal is to make a database for cancer genomics for all types of cancers. So far 138 663 CNV profiles (of these are 115 357 tumor CNV profiles) and 51 distinctie national Cancer Institute Thesaurus Cancer Terms are included. The main goal of Progenetix is to build a \"publicly accessibe cancer genome data resource\" and to \"provide a comprehensive representation of genomic variation profiles in cancer\". One can access sample-specific CNA profiles, their metadata, data-annotation, meta-analysis, and visualization. This is an ongoing project, as can be seen, in the past 7 years the cancer loci-specific data growth quadrupled. NCIt, ICOD-3 and UBERON All 3 are ontologies. NCIt (National Cancer Institute Thesaurus) classifies and describes Cancer types. It is constructed by text mining and expert curation for annotation of medical data. International Classification of Disease in Ontoltogy 3rd Edition (ICD-O-3) for cancer sample classification. Prevalent annotation method with shortcomings. Struggles to represent hierarchichal concepts NClt, in comparison can do this but is still rarely used due to ist novelty. Progenetix uses a mixture of ICD-O-NCIt for read mappings (like NCIt is available as well) so all cancer samples in Progenetix have been annotated in NCIt ontology. Uberon is an anatomical ontology that allows for linking of several databases. The represented classes reach across species and focuses on structural anatomical despriptions. This can be connected to ICD-O-T codes so that the cancer types could me mapped to anatomical regions. What are Cnv segmentations and CNV frequencies and how to use them? In the process of CNV analysis segmentation is useful for a comprehensive overview of variations. Here, they determined allele-specific copy number abberations by comparing allele data from SNP-arrays using the B-allele-frequency (BAF). This enables detection of Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events on the chromosomes in respective regions. Segmentation then groups regions with longer stretches of consistent LOH events that can be further evaluated for copy number loss or gain. CNV frequency would describe then how often this variation occurs across several samples. With this, common or rare alterations could be identified. What is an API and how is it used in Progenetix An API (Appplication Programming Interface) is a set of commands, functions, protocols and objects that programmers can use to create a software or to interact with external systems.[^1] In Progenetix one can query for information on CNV frequencies derived from an extensive, well-annotated and standartized database . It is highly relevant in cancer genomics and enables filtering based on selected categories. It is based on the Beacon v2 API created by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) that creates a federated framework to inquire extensive information on genomic studies.! How does Progenetix Visualize CNA profiles? In the user interface, the loss and gain regions are shown next to a karyogram. In the search for a certain cna one can query for biosamples with this respective range. Furthermore, studies are geo-tagged and shown on a geographical map and one can follow external links to view variant alignment. One can search for ceratin cancer types in a hierarchical tree with NCIT Ontology.

PMID: 38464367; PMCID: PMC10921165. Background Globally, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common metabolic disorders. T2DM physiopathology is influenced by complex interrelationships between genetic, metabolic and lifestyle factors (including diet), which differ between populations and geographic regions. In fact, excessive consumptions of high fat/high sugar foods generally increase the risk of developing T2DM, whereas habitual intakes of plant-based healthy diets usually exert a protective effect. Moreover, genomic studies have allowed the characterization of sequence DNA variants across the human genome, some of which may affect gene expression and protein functions relevant for glucose homeostasis. This comprehensive literature review covers the impact of gene-diet interactions on T2DM susceptibility and disease progression, some of which have demonstrated a value as biomarkers of personal responses to certain nutritional interventions. From: GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS AS BIOMARKERS OF GLYCEMIC RESPONSES TO DIETARY ADVICE Also, obese individuals who were homozygous for the T-risk allele of the transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 polymorphism and consumed a high-fat (40%-45% E) diet, underwent smaller reductions in HOMA-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) ^44 . From cited study in review: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 associates with type 2 diabetes and may operate via impaired glucagon-like peptide 1 secretion, which is stimulated more by fat than by carbohydrate ingestion. Design: European, obese participants (n = 771) were randomly assigned to receive an HF or an LF diet. Body weight, fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), waist circumference (WC), resting energy expenditure (REE), fasting fat oxidation in percentage of REE (FatOx), homeostasis model assessed insulin release (HOMA-\u03b2), and HOMA\u2013insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were determined at baseline and after the intervention; 739 individuals were genotyped for rs7903146. Results: Average weight loss was 6.9 kg with the LF and 6.6 kg with the HF (difference between diets, NS) diet. Among individuals who were homozygous for the T-risk allele , those in the HF diet group experienced smaller weight losses (\u0394weight) (2.6 kg; P = 0.009; n = 622 ), smaller \u0394FFM (1.6 kg; P = 0.027; n = 609) , smaller \u0394WC (3.3 cm; P = 0.010; n = 608) , and a smaller \u0394HOMA-IR (1.3 units; P = 0.004; n = 615) than did the LF diet group. For C allele carriers, there were no differences between the HF and LF diet groups. For the HF diet group, each additional T allele was associated with a reduced loss of FM (0.67 kg; P = 0.019; n = 609). TCF7L2 rs7903146 was not associated with \u0394REE, \u0394FatOx, \u0394HOMA-\u03b2, or dropout.","title":"SNP Understanding Question"},{"location":"Sarah-Loose/250415_SNP_Loose/#snp-understanding-question","text":"","title":"SNP Understanding Question"},{"location":"Sarah-Loose/250415_SNP_Loose/#explore-these-snps","text":"number SNP (rsID) Gene / Region Notable Trait / Use 1 rs7903146 TCF7L2 Type 2 Diabetes 2 rs1426654 SLC24A5 Skin Pigmentation 3 rs429358 APOE Alzheimer's Disease 4 rs334 HBB Sickle Cell Anemia 5 rs12913832 HERC2 Eye Color For each SNP, answer the following: SNP (rsID) Chromosome and position Variant Type Reference/ alternate allels MAF rs7903146 Chromosome 10:112998590 fw intron variant C/G/T(forward strand) 0.40 rs1426654 Chromosome 15:48134287 fw missense variant A/G/T, Ancestral: G 0.50 rs429358 Chromosome 19:44908684 fw missense variant T/C, Ancestral: C 0.38 rs334 Chromosome 11:5227002 fw missense variant T/A/C/G 0.14 rs12913832 Chromosome 15:28120472 fw intron variant A/C/G, Ancestral: A 0.43 What is the allele frequency of this SNP in different populations (e.g., AFR, EUR, EAS)?

The names can be understood intuitively. So it is clear, that whilst the first method is gene-focused, faster and cheaper, the latter method contains more extensive information and thus requires more sophisticated storage options. FASTA When Sequencing data is retrieved, on each position there is a likelihood estimated to which base is located there. FASTA files contain the text-based result showing the assembled sequence based on maximum base likelihood in each position, but don\u00b4t include any metadata like about quality of reads. The FASTQ file, an extension of FASTA, contains these Quality Scores (Phred Scores) which can be later used for variant calling or other analyses.[^2] This is useful in the analysis pipeline to ensure quality at this step. They are usually encoded in 8-bit ASCII, therefore one character (base) needs 1 byte storage. SAM and BAM These Sequences can then be aligned and mapped to a reference. The mapping can be stored in mainly two different format types. A more outdated format is the SAM (Sequence alignment and map) file, a human-accessible text file (ASCII encoded) that uses massive amount of storage. SAM files have been mainly replaced by BAM (Binary alignment/ map) files, that uses compressed data with Indices. Here, in binary-encoded files, a single base can be described by only 2 bits per base. However, these file types contain elements with variable lengths (CIGAR, Header, flags). A BAM file can be reduced in size compared to a SAM file up to ~50%. The file can represent aligned sequences up to 128 Mb so file size can differ here. [^1] CRAM An even more efficient form of the BAM file is the CRAM file, uses reference-based compression compared to BAM data, so it only stores differences from the reference. Furthermore, it seperates additional data from the Sequencing file and compresses each data type most effficiently. Therefore BAM and CRAM file formats are often used for archival purposes and storing this alignment data.[^3][^4] A CRAM is about half the size of a BAM file. VCF As a next step, variants between the sequence data and the referenca can be identified by variant calling. The Variant Call Format (VCF) is a popular option. It is a plain text file (ASCII), containing meta data, variant attributes like location or type of variants (SNPs, Indels, etc.). 'There are about 5 million mutations per person in the WGS VCF file, which is about 0.16% of the total 3 billion bp' , according to this resource. This can be used for a single sequence or many different samples. A shortcoming of this format would occur in the latter case. For any variant will have an entry for every sample, therefore, if rare variants occur, for every sample a line would be added stating no change, thus including redundant information. VCF files are often compressed as .gzip. If we assume so 150 bytes x 5.000.000 = 0.75 GB per genome and 750 GB per 1000 genomes. Another useful file format are Browser Extensible Data (BED) Files, that can be uploaded to genome browsers like IGV to visualize read mapping, thus aiding in mapping quality control or variant annotation further down the analysis pipeline. ^5 Application Since I am a Microbiologist, if I wanted to sequence for example the E. coli genome, I would obtain FASTQ files for my raw reads, use BAM file format to store my read mapping, store variants in VCF format and annotate my findings in BED file format. SAM file formats could be useful for momentary interaction with the data, but not for long-term storage. Generally, one needs to find a balance between data compression and retaining information. For small, bacterial genomes like E. coli\u00b4s this would pose not so much of a challenge (~4.6 Mbp). However, if we look at human genomes (WGS ~3,200 Mbp, WES ~50 Mbp) CRAM format should definitly be preferred. This concerns WGS more than WES, since in WES a minor fraction of the genome is actually used when only the coding regions are considered.

Are there any adapter sequences in the data? Why do you think this is? For all patients we have a forward and reverese sequenced fastq file. For all 3 patients the data is the same here. We are dealing with simulated sequence data so the quality scores per base are uniformly ideal and we can\u00b4t see a boxplots with a quality estimation. Q2 Given the FastQC reports, does it make sense to perform adapter and/or quality-trimming on your data? No, since our read quality does not decrease towards any end in our simulated data. Additionaly, If we navigate to the \"Adapter Content\" tab, we see no adapter sequences occuring, only minimal poly-A content towards the end of the sequences, which should be fine. Q3 Why are so many files in the bioinformatics pipeline compressed and indexed? We are dealing with immense amounts of data here. Indexed and compressed or binary files can be more easily and quickly navigated, transferred or accessed. Indexing allows for easier and faster workflows, since it provides a focus on a target region of interest, which can directly be queried. Compressed formats are helpful for long-term data storage, reducing cost and environmental impact greatly. Q4 In the bash script that processes alignment files, you will see calls to samtools sort, samtools view, and samtools index (among others). Explain what these three programs do. Why do you think each program is needed?

More specifically, it sorts alignments by left-most coordinates. This makes it faster to process the file downstream. samtools view This converts and views SAM, BAM and CRAM files. In our case we converted a humam-readable, text-based SAM file into a binary, indexed and compressed BAM file. samtools index This indexes SAM, BAM and CRAM files. As can be seen in the script, the created indices allow for fast random data access in specified regions of interest. Q5 Explain what files are needed for GangSTR to run. Specifically: explain what information is provided to GangSTR via the --ref, --region, and --bam command line arguments. Hint: look at the GangSTR manual . GangSTR is used to identify short tandem repeats ( STR ) in a genome based on short reads (obtained by e.g. NGS). Input data: BAM files (aligned reads) The above mentioned commands are used to run GangSTR with default parameters. GangSTR --bam file.bam --ref ref.fa --regions regions.bed --out outprefix --ref: this specifies the reference genome that will be used ( fasta file) to align the repeat regions to. --region: this specifies the tandem repeat target loci, e.g. our regions of interest on a certain chromosome by inputting a .bed file. --bam: this enables us to feed the program several .bam files containing aligned reads to a reference genome. The files can be listed comma-seperated. Literature During the practical so far, you have generated variant calls from short read sequencing data using bioinformatics approaches. Now it's time to take a step back and do some background reading in order to prepare for the analysis and interpretation of the results next week. First, read the following sections of this review: - Abstract - Introduction - Genotyping STRs from high-throughput sequencing data. Then, answer Q6 and Q7. Q6 Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? Short Tandem Repeats ( STR ) are mutation hotspots due to their repetitive nature, especially for de-novo mutations and especially for indels. We can differentiate between STR expansion or deletion, where STR expansions mostly pathogenic (f.ex.: fragile x Syndrome). These seemingly non-coding DNA pieces are anything but useless though. They can play a role in Transcriptionfactor binding, regulatory element spacing, DNA hypermethylation or heterochromatinization, may hinder regular splicing or can lead to the formation of Toxic RNA and Protein aggregates. Examples of pathogenic effects can include polyglutamine aggregation, intronic GGGGCC repeat, which plays a role in ALS pathogenicity, and many more, as can be seen in the figure fron the paper. [^1] Q7 What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? Common challenges in STR analysis from NGS data include that short read sequencing cannot cover longer repeats. Furthermore, large indels are difficult to accurately align to a reference genome, so shorter alleles are disproportionate mapped and thus overrepresented. Additionally, in PCR-based approaches, during library preparation, the number of STRs gets misrepresented This can be overcome by bioinformatic products like lobSTR. There, mapping bias is overcome by using an entropy-based metric to detect repetitive reads and aligns only the non-repetitive regions to the reference genome. A model of STR stutter errors, which are introduced by PCR-absed approaches, then determine the maximum likelihood genotype at each locus[^1]. Second, read the following sections of the paper describing GangSTR: - Abstract - Introduction - Overview of the GangSTR model .Then, answer Q8 and Q9. Q8 What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools? GangSTR enables genome-wide analysis of TR from NGS data. This application overcomes previous challenges by using a general statistical model that forms a maximum-likelihood model from the properties of the short paired-end reads from the NGS data. This works for genotyping of normal length and expanded repeats. GangSTR is furthermore more accurate and faster than previous methods. This tool is not limited to reads shorter than 70 bp or motif repeat lengths of no more than 6 bp like STRetch or HipSTR, which previously was disadvantageous for identifying expanded repeats which play a role in pathogenic trait development. It is and end-to-end method, that doesn\u00b4t only rely on enclosing reads, but that works by using sequence alignments and a reference set of TRs to construct an estimation of diploid repeat lengths. Ist data source are, as mentioned above, properties of short paired-end reads, from which a maximum likelihood model is constructed that then is applied to every TR genomewide. This enables one to identify length of a repetitive region, by counting the repeats between enclosing reads. Additionally, information like coverage, frame length and presence of partially enclosing reads is used to construct two types of probability. They constucted 4 classes for their reads, E for enclosing, S for spanning reads (they cover the entire repeat length), F for flanking read pairs and FRR for fully repetitive read pairs. Then 2 types of probability are computed: class probability, if the read pair of a certain class can be observed based on the. True genotype and read probability for predicting read pair properties[^2]. Q9 What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping? - short paired-end read data from NGS (coverage, frame length, content of enclosing reads) - Read classification (class: E, S, F, FRR and read probability) [^1]: A genomic view of short tandem repeats [^2]: Profiling the genome-wide landscape of tandem repeat expansions","title":"Questions Day 7: Varant Calling Analysis Pipeline, STR and GangSTR"},{"location":"Sarah-Loose/250416_SLoose_questions_day_7/#questions-day-7-varant-calling-analysis-pipeline-str-and-gangstr","text":"","title":"Questions Day 7: Varant Calling Analysis Pipeline, STR and GangSTR"},{"location":"Sarah-Loose/250416_SLoose_questions_day_7/#q1","text":"Does the sequence quality graph of your data look different from the examples shown in the slides?

What is Glioblastoma? Glioblastoma is a fast-growing and highly malignant brain tumor. It belongs to a broader group of brain tumors called gliomas, which come from the brain\u2019s supportive glial cells. Tumors are graded by the WHO based on how aggressive they are: -Grade I: Benign, slow-growing, with a good prognosis -Grade II: Low-grade but likely to recur -Grade III: Malignant -Grade IV: Very malignant, fast-growing, and with a poor prognosis (e.g., glioblastoma) There are different types of Glioblastomas, like: -Astrocytomas: Arise from star-shaped glial cells and occur across all grades. -Glioblastomas: A highly malignant astrocytoma (WHO grade IV). -Oligodendrogliomas: Originate from oligodendrocytes and occur in various grades. -Ependymomas: Develop from cells lining the brain\u2019s ventricles. Glioblastoma is relatively rare. In Switzerland, about 3 in 100,000 people are diagnosed every year. It is more common in men and mostly occurs between the ages of 50 and 70. The known risk factors are limited and include childhood brain radiation and very rare genetic syndromes, though most patients have no real identifiable risk. Symptoms depend on where the tumor is located in the brain. They can include: -Headaches, nausea, or dizziness -Seizures, especially first-time seizures in adults -Cognitive issues like forgetfulness or confusion -Neurological problems such as weakness, numbness, vision or speech issues, or -coordination difficulties -Changes in mood, personality, or behavior -Because glioblastomas grow quickly, symptoms tend to appear suddenly and should prompt -medical evaluation. source: USZ Lets start to code Clear R's brain rm(list = ls()) Install packages if (!require(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\"BiocManager\") BiocManager::install(version = \"3.20\") BiocManager::install(c(\"pgxRpi\", \"GenomicRanges\")) Load Packages library(pgxRpi) library(GenomicRanges) My Glioblastoma data is on the progenetic website .

Copy number variations (CNVs) are variations in the number of copies of a DNA segment between different individuals genomes. They can be very short (at least 50 bp) or affect long stretches or DNA. However, there are different definitions and opinions for the lower limit in the literature. CNVs come from structural chromosomal aberrations, in detail duplicatons or deletions. The regions may or may not contain gene(s). Healthy individuals also have very small CNVs, but in Cancer patients they are larger and of higher amplitude. THe phenotypic effects of CNV are very divers and can be adaptive traits, embryonic lethality or can lead to different diseases like autism, schizophrenia and Crohn's disease(see lecture 1 BIO 390, NIH and Zarrei et. al. ).

Describe NCIt, ICD-O, UBERON codes, and their relationships. NCIt - National Cancer Institute Thesaurus: Is a widely recognized standard for biomedical coding and reference. It provides a clinical science-based ontology used in NCI semantic infrastructure and information systems. It includes terminology for clinical care, basic and translational research, administrative activities and public infromation (see NIH . ICD-O - International Classification of Diseases for Oncology: Is a coding system, primarily used in tumor or cancer registries. It is used for coding the site (topography) and the histology of neoplasms (see WHO . UBERON: is an anatomy ontology for cross-species and classifies according to traditional anatomical criteria, closely aligned with developmental processes. It includes other taxon-specific anatomical ontologies and therefore allows the integration of phenotype, functional and expression data. The Terminology contains anatomical terms in NCIt, that are mapped to equvalent terms in meaning in UBERON. Therefore UBERON and NCIt are closely related. Lately, all existing ICD-O T codes have ben mapped to UBEROn terms, which also relates them closely. (see UBERON terminology files and Huang et. al. ) What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them? CNV frequencies are the percentages of samples in a population that have CNVs in genomic regions. With the CNV frequencies, the distribution of CNVs across different populations can be analyzed and patterns of variation and maybe associations with phenotypic traits can identified (see Ionita-Laza et. al. ). CNV segmentations: CNV segments can be defined as partial regions of a CNV and they enable comparisons of CNVs between populations of interest. The CNV segments can be genotyped and the genotype frequency can be calculated. Application of CNV segment analysis has contributed to the identification of multiple regions and genes that may play roles in diseases, body traits, and breed differentiation (see Zhou et. al. ). What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix? \u201cDatabases can be accessed through Application Programming Interfaces - APIs. They are a set of routines, protocols, and tools that specifies how software components interact, to exchange data and processing capabilities. Web APIs provide a machine readable response to queries over HTTP. Bioinformatic applications frequently make use of web APIs for data retrieval or genome browser APIs for data display\" (see lecture 1 BIO 390) In Progenetix, some different APIs are implemented to facilitate access to the database. How does progenetix visualize CNA profiles? When using Progenetix to, for example, look at one specific cancer type's CNVs, you find Histograms, showing the frequencies of Copy Number Gains and Copy Number Losses for the 22 autosomes. What do you think should be improved in progenetix? Maybe from include more data on rare type cancers, the research on those diseases would benefit. However, since those are rare, I assume there is not that much data accessible. full text article references: Zarrei, M., MacDonald, J., Merico, D. et al.

WGS sequences the entire genome, so it includes protein-coding and non-protein-coding regions. Therefore, allmost all changes in the DNA can be identified. WES only sequences the protein - coding regions. It is cheaper, since the ampunt of data generated is sigcnificantly less then with WGS. The majority of diease-causing variants are in the exome, therefore WES is quite a powerful tool to identify genetic causes for disease. However, WGS provides a more compreensive picture of other variants. Especially rare and novel variants might be missed with WES (see source ). Di\ufb00erent file formats SAM/BAM: SAM stands for Sequence Alignment/Map format, and is a generic alignment format for storing read alignments against reference sequences. It supports short and long reads produced by different sequencing platforms. A SAM fil is a tab-delimited text file that contains sequence alignment data. BAM is the binary version of a SAM file. Both files contain same information and with SAMtools software, a BAM file can be easily converted to SAM file. They have import roles in analysis of next-generation sequencing data because the raw sequence reads from sequencers have no genomic position information associated and they must be mapped/aligned to known reference genome. The mapping/alignment outputs are BAM/SAM files and they are further used for downstream analysis. A SAM/BAM file consists of header section and alignment section. VCF: The VCF Variant Call Format is an example for a widely used file format with \"built-in logic\". It provids \"logic compression\" for genomic annotations which rely on the notion of \"assessed variant in a population\". It is complex to interpret, but there is no replacement in sight (but new versions) (see BIO 390, lecture 1). It was initially introduced by the 1000 Genomes Project to store the most prevalent types of genomic sequence variation, such as SNPs and small INDELS, enriched by annotations. VCF file is text file and contains meta-information (header) lines and data lines. FASTA: FASTA format is a text based format and has been standard format for nucleotide sequence since the first generation sequencing. For next-generation sequencing, it is the standard format for reference genome sequences used by mapping/alignment software tools. A FASTA file starts with a header line followed by lines of sequence. The header line begins with a \u201c>\u201d sign for sequence identifier and may contain optional descriptive information. Sequence lines consist of characters representing nucleotide bases in the sequence and are usually no more than 80 characters per line, but there are no limitation for total number of lines. Same as sequence in FASTQ files, each nucleotide base is encoded as a single character (one of A, T, G, C, and N if undetermined, with case insensitive). FASTA format can be used to display sequence of a single gene, a single chromosome, or multiple ones. (see Zhang H.) How much computer storage is required for the different file formats? File Type WES (100x) WGS (30x) for 1000 Genomes SAM 13 GB 180 GB 180 TB BAM 8 GB 100 GB 100 TB VCF 0.1 GB 1 GB 1 TB What are the different file formats typically used for: FASTA: is essentially for storing and exchanging sequence data SAM: stores text based mapping information. It can be compressed to BAM, which is a binary version of SAM and is more compressed and therefore better suitable for storing the data VCF: is good to store genome variant, including annotations Cost factors This ofcourse differs for different institutions and countries. - Cost estimates for a single WES test ranged from $555 to $5,169 - Cost estimates for a single WGS test ranged from $1,906 to $24,810 At the Helath 2030 Genome Center in Switzerland the costs are: WES, ~ 40 mio clusters, 2 x 100bp reads (~ 70x coverage) 460 CHF / sample WGS, ~ 375 mio clusters, 2 x 150bp reads (~ 30x coverage) 905 CHF / sample So, as discussed before, WES is cheaper than WGS, since we only sequence parts and not the whole genome. Regarding the storage of the different file formats, it was hard to find specific information. Obviously, soting BAM fiels is cheaper than SAM files, since they are more compressed and therefore are the more suitable candidate for data storage. As far as I know, CRAM is a BAM file, but even more compressed, therefore it must be cheaper to store too. Since FASTA is only raw sequencing data, without any alignments, mapping and information like quality scores, it is way cheaper than SAM, BAM and CRAM files. Also VCF files are qay smaller than BAM, SAM and CRAM files, since they dont contain whole genomes + additional information, but only the variant information. This makes it also cheaper to store.

Are there any adapter sequences in the data? Why do you think this is? Since it is just simulated data, we did not recieva a sequence quality graph and therefore can't answer this question. Q2 Given the FastQC reports, does it make sense to perform adapter and/or quality-trimming on your data? Same as Q1, we cannot really answer this question with our simulated data. However, theoretically, if our qualtiy scores go below orange, so in the red coloured area, we shoudl trim them. This ensures reasonable quality. Q3 Why are so many files in the bioinformatics pipeline compressed and indexed? - Compression: to save storage space -> when we compress, we need less disk space - Indexing: to faster retrive information without having to read the entire file. Q4 In the bash script that processes alignment files, you will see calls to samtools sort, samtools view, and samtools index (among others). Explain what these three programs do. Why do you think each program is needed? samtools sort: it sorts the alginments in a BAM/CAM/CRAM files. By default, it is sorting by the leftmost coordinate, but it can also srot be a specific tag, read name or minimiser. It is needed for indexing and more efficient access to specific regions is possible when the BAM files are sorted. Additionally, it is imporving compression ,which of course saves disk space and it is the standard Format, that most tools use. samtools view: it views and converts SAM/BAM/CRAM files. By default, it outputs alignments in the SAM format. Additionaly, one can add filters for specific alignments to be shown, change the output format and specify the output name. ONe can also look at specific regions, for example only at chromosome 1 or a specific range at chromosome 5. It requires an indexed and coordinate-sorted CRAM/BAM file. It is obviously needed for viewing, but also for filtering reads and to convert SAM files to BAM files (which are much smaller and therefore faster to process). samtools index: indexes SAM/BAM/CRAM files. It enables fast danrom acces, for example to a specific genomic region (with samtools view). It workes with compressed (BAM/CRAM/SAM.GZ) and sorted files and creates .bam.bai, .bam.csi or .cram.crai files. In short, this commands allows you to quickly jump to genomic regions of your interest. source: Samtools manual . Q5 Explain what files are needed for GangSTR to run. Specifically: explain what information is provided to GangSTR via the --ref, --region, and --bam command line arguments. The parameters in GangSTR are: - bam Comma separated list of input BAM files - ref Refererence genome (.fa) - regions Target TR loci (regions) (.bed) - out Output prefix source: GangSTR manual . Literature During the practical so far, you have generated variant calls from short read sequencing data using bioinformatics approaches. Now it's time to take a step back and do some background reading in order to prepare for the analysis and interpretation of the results next week. First, read the following sections of this review : * Abstract * Introduction`` * Genotyping STRs from high-throughput sequencing data Then, answer Q4 and Q5. Q6 Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? STR expansion has been implicated with dozens of disorders. This is not only because STRs exhibit very high mutation rates, but also induce a variety of pathogenic effects, like hypermethylation, polyglutamine aggregation and repeat associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. Additionally, smaller athogenic repeats are affecting RNA splicing and to regulate gene expression. These mechanisms seem to be a genome-wide phenomena. Q7 What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? the short reads are often not spanning entire repeats, which effectively reduces the number of informative reads. The STR vraiations that are present as lage deletions or insertions may be difficult to align to a reference genome. This can introduce a mapping bias toward the shorter alleles. When the sample is amplificated with PCR during library preperation, \"stutter\" noise is often introduced in the number of repeats at STRs. Second, read the following sections of the paper describing GangSTR : * Abstract * Introduction * Overview of the GangSTR model Then, answer Q6 and Q7. Q8 What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools? NGS is the gold standard for diagnostic sequencing, since it is chep and achieves a high throughput. However, the NGS pipelines struggled eiwth highly repetitive reions in the genome, and they therefore are often filtered as a result. In detail, repeats longer than ~70bp are difficult or even impossible to genotype, because there is an insuffivient number of enclodes reads. Also, pother used platforms are facing difficulties: in a recent genome-wide analysis conducted with HipSTR, more than 150,000 STRs were filtered, although they included known pathogenic TR expansions. SRTetch, on the other hand, can perform genome-wide exoansion identification, but is not able to analyze short TRs. Tredparse can not estimate repeat lenghts longer than the seqeuncing fragment lenght, and ExpansionHunter stops producing accurate genotypes when both alleles are close to or longer than the seqeuncing read lenthy. Additionally, those two platforms - Tredparse and ExpansionHunter - have not been designed fro genome wide scales. GansgSTR on the other hand, has proven to be faster and to provide more accurate results compared to the existing solutions. This was tested on real and simulated datasets, with different kinds of allele lengths. Most existing tools have mainly focused on repeat-enclosing reads. GangSTR on the other hand, incorperates other pieces of information, like fragment length, coverage and the existence partially enclosing reads. All those features are functions of repeat number. GangSTR incorperates those other informative aspects into a single joint likelihood framework. Q9 What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping? I answered this already in Question 8, in Detail: Most existing tools have mainly focused on repeat-enclosing reads. GangSTR on the other hand, incorperates other pieces of information, like fragment length, coverage and the existence partially enclosing reads. All those features are functions of repeat number.

When are they used? What are the costs and how are they influenced? These questions will be briefly answered below. Before we dive into the different file formats, it is important to mention the difference between Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) . When WES is performed, only the protein-coding parts of the genome \u2013 the exome \u2013 is sequenced. Compared to WGS, where both coding and non-coding regions are sequenced, WES is much cheaper and produces less data. As there is much more data generated with WGS, there is also more storage required and more computing power for analysis, which affects costs. Size estimate of Human Genome \u2248 3.2 *10^9 base pairs Size estimate of Human Exome \u2248 30\u201350 million base pairs For the cost estimates below (storage of 1000 genomes) I used the size of the whole genome. Which file formats are there? SAM: SAM stands for Sequence Alignment/Map format. It describes the alignment of sequencing reads to a reference sequence or assembly. It is a tab-delimited file, which was developed from the 1000 genome project. It is simple and easily generated. BAM: BAM stands for Binary Alignment Map and is the binary equivalent to the SAM format. A BAM file contains the same information as a SAM file, but has much smaller file size, as it is compressed. Compared to SAM files, BAM files are not readable. BED: BED stands for Browser Extensible Data and is a way to describe basic features on a sequence. Each feature is represented by a single line, typically with 3 to 12 columns of data. BED files are commonly used to define user-specified sequence features and visualisation of these features. FASTA/FASTQ: FASTA is a simple and widely supported format to represent biological sequences. It includes a sequence name, an optional description (for example metadata or sequencing details) and the sequence itself. The sequences are formatted in plain text and therefore readable. Raw reads from a sequencer are often in the FASTA format. FASTQ is similar to FASTA, but already with quality scores included. VCF: VCF stands for Variant Call Format. It is a standard file format for storing DNA variation data, including SNPs, insertions, deletions and structural variants, together with annotations and metadata. There is a header (metadata etc.) and a body. Each line of the body describes variants present in the sampled population at one genomic position or region. When to use which one? SAM: For inspection of aligned reads BAM: For efficient storage of aligned reads BED: When working with regions (not sequences) and to visualize these regions FASTA: To store (reference-) sequences and or raw reads from sequencer VCF: To store and analyze human genome variants Cost estimates for storing 1000 genomes: Of the 5 mentioned file formats, in my opinion it makes most sense to store a genome in a BAM file , because a binary format needs less storage and the BAM format is suitable to store aligned reads. 2 bits are enough to encode A, C, G, T. Therefore I made the calculations with 2 bits per base. Ideally, we would have 3.2 * 10^9 bases multiplied by 2 bits --> 6.4 billion bits --> 0.8 GigaBytes per genome But in real life we need to consider coverage, which influences BAM file size. According to a website I found ( Guide to Storage and Computation Requirements ), we can reach up to ~ 150 GigaBytes per genome , when we have a coverage of 35x to 40x and read lengths of 75 bases or longer. Costs for 1000 genomes per month (storage only): Ideally --> 0.8GB * 1000 * $0.15 = 120$ per month Realistically --> 150GB * 1000 * $0.15 = up to 22\u2019500$ per month Cost assumption: $0.15 per GB, see Microsoft Storage Pricing Conclusion: What influences the storage costs?

A pangenome integrates sequence information from multiple genomes. So instead of looking at only one genome and using it as a reference, we now look at genomic information of diverse individuals to create a new, maybe more adequate and complete reference. This new reference genome is interesting because it has many advantages compared to older reference genomes like GRCh38. One of the key advantages is that it is able to represent polymorphic structural variants, because with the pangenome we allow for multiple versions of one genomic region to coexist. With that we can see genetic diversity across individuals but also across populations. When looking at a single reference genome, we fail to see these variations, which can lead to reference bias. What\u2019s the T2T approach and what is its role in the Human Pangenome Project? In the Telomere-to Telomere (T2T) approach a genome is sequenced completely, meaning from one telomere to the other telomere, without gaps. This is possible thanks to long-read sequencing (PacBio HiFi for example). With this T2T approach we can capture all genetic sequences, also sequences that were hard to sequence in the past. In older reference genomes like GRCh38 we still had unresolved regions, mostly in centromeres but also in repeat-rich areas in general and regions with segmental duplications, which are often close to the telomeres. This was mainly due to technical difficulties; on one hand we have had the short-read sequencing limitations and on the other hand we have had assemblers that couldn\u2019t resolve duplications for example. The T2T approach eliminates these gaps. This is from importance for the pangenome project, as they are using T2T methods to assemble their genomes and therefore ensuring that they have full assemblies. All in all, we can summarize the advantages of the T2T approach and the pangenome project as following: Performance improvement in challenging and medically relevant regions, which could for example be important for disease diagnosis and precision medicine in general. These approaches are better in calling small variants than older approaches. More structural variants are detected, a lot of them were missed when we have short-read-based sequencing techniques. Better representation of centromeric, sub-telomeric and repeat-rich regions. Compared to a linear reference we now have a graph-based genome, which allows multiple genetic paths. In conclusion we can say that these are very promising approaches, which could lead to more precise disease diagnosis, more effective drug development but could also give more insights into human evolutionary history for example. There are many remaining challenges, as for example the remaining base level sequencing errors. One of the next goals would be to include many more diverse individuals in the pangenome and to refine the pangenome alignment methods. These methods could then also further be of value for other species for example.","title":"A draft human pangenome reference"},{"location":"majorie-baertschi/majorie-baertschi-pangenome-assignment-day2/#a-draft-human-pangenome-reference","text":"","title":"A draft human pangenome reference"},{"location":"majorie-baertschi/majorie-baertschi-pangenome-assignment-day2/#a-paper-by-liao-paten-et-al-published-in-2023","text":"A brief summary of why the pangenome approach and the T2T approach are interesting, in what regard they differ from previous approaches and what future benefits could come from these new approaches.

Are there any adapter sequences in the data? Why do you think this is? They look very different from the ones we saw in the slides. The 'per base sequence quality' boxplot looks uniform. We don't have real quality scores. This is the case because we have simulated data. Simulated data is sometimes used in tutorials and teaching. Or to test pipelines etc. and see how your code works. Normally quality scores give us information about how confident the sequencer was about calling a specific base. When we have simulated data we don't have actual base calling, therefore phred quality scores are just fixed or pre-defined. We don't see any adapter sequences being present. This makes sense when we consider that it is simulated data we look at. Adapters are important for real sequencing, but are not real biologic sequences. So ideally they shouldn't end up in the final data. Sometimes this can happen when we have real sequencing data, then we would see adapter sequences in the FastQC data. When we have simulated data, we don't see adapters as we have simulators that model an \"idealized sequencing process\". Q2 Given the FastQC reports, does it make sense to perform adapter and/or quality-trimming on your data? No because we don't have bad quality scores. Trimming is done to remove adapters or low-quality bases, which does not make sense in our case, as we have simulated data. Normally in the 'per base sequence quality' boxplot when we would see the quality score dropping into the red area, we would trim. Q3 Why are so many files in the bioinformatics pipeline compressed and indexed? Compressed: Many files are compressed as it is much more efficient. Compressed files are smaller, leading to lower storage costs. Sequencing data coming directly from the sequencer (FASTA files...) or alignment files (SAM...) for example are very large, plus they are time and cost effcient, considering storage for example. Therefore it makes sense to compress them, as many programs are able to directly use the compressed files and do not need to decompress them first. Indexed: It makes sense to index files, as sequence or alignment files are rather large. When we index these large files it helps us to access a specific region of interest in the genome much faster. When we want to look at a certain position on a chromosome, to see whether we have some kind of copy number variation for example, indices help us to find these positions we want to analyse. Q4 In the bash script that processes alignment files, you will see calls to samtools sort, samtools view, and samtools index (among others). Explain what these three programs do. Why do you think each program is needed? Hint: look at the Samtools manual . samtools sort : When samtools sort is used (without further options), all our alignments are sorted by their leftmost coordinate, which could be for example the position on the chromosome. Different sorting options can be applied, the alignments are then for example sorted by read names or by minimiser (when reads are unmapped). A sort order header is added and the sorted output can be stored in a BAM file or CRAM file for example. This tool is important, because it enables further downstream analysis. If we want to index it later and then call variants or visalize data for example, it is important that the alignments are sorted first. samtools view : When no further options are applied, this tool prints all alignments in the file that you specify as input file. If you only want to have a specific region printed you add the region after the filename input; chr12 or chr12:200 for example. Then we only get alignments of chromosome 12 printed or in the second example the region on chromosome 12 beginning at base position 200. More than one region can be specified. To access these specific regions the input file needs to be sorted (by default) and indexed. This tool is important, because it allows us to see specific regions, that can be directly printed on the screen. Often we only want to analyze one part of the genome, therefore this tool is great to specify these regions and further analyze them. The tool is also very important because it can be used for file format conversion. It converts SAM/BAM/CRAM files. This is important because certain tools for example specifically require BAM files. samtools index : This tool indexes SAM, BAM or CRAM files. SAM files first need to be BGZF compressed for the indexing to work. This tool is important because it allows fast access. It's also important when later a tool is used that requires indices. For example when we use samtools view (as explained above) and we want to specify a region. This only works if we have an indexed file. Q5 Explain what files are needed for GangSTR to run.

Are there any adapter sequences in the data? Why do you think this is? They look very different from the ones we saw in the slides. The 'per base sequence quality' boxplot looks uniform. We don't have real quality scores. This is the case because we have simulated data. Simulated data is sometimes used in tutorials and teaching. Or to test pipelines etc. and see how your code works. Normally quality scores give us information about how confident the sequencer was about calling a specific base. When we have simulated data we don't have actual base calling, therefore phred quality scores are just fixed or pre-defined. We don't see any adapter sequences being present. This makes sense when we consider that it is simulated data we look at. Adapters are important for real sequencing, but are not real biologic sequences. So ideally they shouldn't end up in the final data. Sometimes this can happen when we have real sequencing data, then we would see adapter sequences in the FastQC data. When we have simulated data, we don't see adapters as we have simulators that model an \"idealized sequencing process\".","title":"Q1"},{"location":"majorie-baertschi/majorie-baertschi-questions_day_07/#q2","text":"Given the FastQC reports, does it make sense to perform adapter and/or quality-trimming on your data? No because we don't have bad quality scores. Trimming is done to remove adapters or low-quality bases, which does not make sense in our case, as we have simulated data. Normally in the 'per base sequence quality' boxplot when we would see the quality score dropping into the red area, we would trim.","title":"Q2"},{"location":"majorie-baertschi/majorie-baertschi-questions_day_07/#q3","text":"Why are so many files in the bioinformatics pipeline compressed and indexed? Compressed: Many files are compressed as it is much more efficient. Compressed files are smaller, leading to lower storage costs. Sequencing data coming directly from the sequencer (FASTA files...) or alignment files (SAM...) for example are very large, plus they are time and cost effcient, considering storage for example. Therefore it makes sense to compress them, as many programs are able to directly use the compressed files and do not need to decompress them first. Indexed: It makes sense to index files, as sequence or alignment files are rather large. When we index these large files it helps us to access a specific region of interest in the genome much faster. When we want to look at a certain position on a chromosome, to see whether we have some kind of copy number variation for example, indices help us to find these positions we want to analyse.","title":"Q3"},{"location":"majorie-baertschi/majorie-baertschi-questions_day_07/#q4","text":"In the bash script that processes alignment files, you will see calls to samtools sort, samtools view, and samtools index (among others). Explain what these three programs do. Why do you think each program is needed? Hint: look at the Samtools manual . samtools sort : When samtools sort is used (without further options), all our alignments are sorted by their leftmost coordinate, which could be for example the position on the chromosome. Different sorting options can be applied, the alignments are then for example sorted by read names or by minimiser (when reads are unmapped). A sort order header is added and the sorted output can be stored in a BAM file or CRAM file for example. This tool is important, because it enables further downstream analysis. If we want to index it later and then call variants or visalize data for example, it is important that the alignments are sorted first. samtools view : When no further options are applied, this tool prints all alignments in the file that you specify as input file. If you only want to have a specific region printed you add the region after the filename input; chr12 or chr12:200 for example. Then we only get alignments of chromosome 12 printed or in the second example the region on chromosome 12 beginning at base position 200. More than one region can be specified. To access these specific regions the input file needs to be sorted (by default) and indexed. This tool is important, because it allows us to see specific regions, that can be directly printed on the screen. Often we only want to analyze one part of the genome, therefore this tool is great to specify these regions and further analyze them. The tool is also very important because it can be used for file format conversion. It converts SAM/BAM/CRAM files. This is important because certain tools for example specifically require BAM files. samtools index : This tool indexes SAM, BAM or CRAM files. SAM files first need to be BGZF compressed for the indexing to work. This tool is important because it allows fast access. It's also important when later a tool is used that requires indices. For example when we use samtools view (as explained above) and we want to specify a region.
